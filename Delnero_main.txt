Text No. 1 - "Dumuzi's Mother's Lament" or "Recognition"
A: CBS 11393 (BE 30/1, 1) + CBS 11389 (unpublished)
B: NBC 1313 (BIN 2, 26)
C: CBS 6891 (SEM 91)
C₁: CBS 6897 (STVC 83), joins CBS 6891 along with several other new pieces.
  C = CBS 6891 + 6897 + 4337 + 4359 (+ others?): left, middle fragment of a multi-column (probably 4-column) tablet containing the ends of lines from columns i and iv and complete lines from columns ii and iii. In spite of the claim that CBS 6897 joins the other pieces it is not physically attached to the other tablet and I could not find anything beyond a note in the drawer saying that it joins CBS 6891, so only 6891+ is collated below.

Lamenting reed, my heart wants to play a lamenting reed in the Steppe.
Falkenstein: "Klagend, klagend geht mein Herz nach der 'Steppe'".

Destroyer of lands, lady of the Eanna, I am, 

5': <*ama> u₃-mu-un-na ga-ša-an sun₂-*na *men₃  
6': <x> *ŋuruš an-na mu-tin-an-na men₃
  Note: Roemer reads "saŋ!?-kal/rib" for the first two signs, but notes the difficulties of interpreting the first sign. Collation of sign does not support "saŋ".

[Mother of the lord, Ninsun, I am] [] = A only
[... of heaven, Geshtinana, I am] 

7': ša₃-ŋu₁₀ gi ir₂-ra edin-na na-mu-ma-al
  B (3b): *ša₃-*ŋu₁₀ gi ir₂-ra <edin>!-na na-*mu-*ma-<al>

My heart wants to play a lamenting reed in the Steppe.

  B (4): ki *ŋuruš-a-ka na-mu-ma-*al ki {d}dumu-*zi-<*da>-*ka

At the place where the young man was present, at the place of Dumuzi,

10' (9'): <*a>-*ra-*li *du₆! *su₈-*ba-*še! 

[In Arali, the ruin hill of the shepherd]

11': ša₃-ŋu₁₀ gi ir₂-ra edin-na na-mu-ma-<al>
  B (5): a-ra-li du₆/UD *ZA.*MUŠ₃-*ka *ša₃-*ŋu₁₀ *ir₂-<ra> [. . .]

In Arali, the hill of shuba-stones, my heart wants to play a lamenting reed.

12': *ki *ŋuruš-*a '' *šu *du₃-*a-*še₃ 
  B (6): [. . .] <*ki> *guruš-*a-*ka /?

At the place where the hands of the young man are bound,

13': *ki *a₂ *la₂-*a {d}dumu-zi-da-<še₃>
  B (7): [. . .] {d}*dumu-*zi-*da-*ka

At the place where the arms of Dumuzi are bound,

14': *ki *u₈-*e *sila₄ *ma-an-ze₂-eŋ₃-ŋa₂-<*še₃>
  Note: the sign read as "ma" is more elongated than the corresponding sign in the following line and looks more like "ma" than "ba", but since the sign in the next line looks more like "ba" and both lines presumably have the same verbal form, it may be better to read "ba" here. Note also that this problem is considered extensively by Roemer, who notes that the sign could be "ma" here, but also reads "ba" in the corresponding form in the next line.  

15': ša₃-ŋu₁₀ gi ir₂-ra *edin-*na
  B (8): <ki>? <x>?-*e sila₄ *ba-*ze₂-*ŋa₂-*ba *ša₃-*ŋu₁₀ *ir₂-*ra

At that place where the ewe gave (up?) the lamb, my heart <<wants to play>> a lamenting reed.
Falkenstein: "nach dem Ort, an dem mir das Schaf das Lamm gab" (assuming ma- instead of ba-). Jacobsen translates "surrender". 

16': *ki *ud₅-*de₃ maš₂ *ba-an-ze₂-eŋ₃-ŋa₂-še₃?
  B (9): *ki *ud₅-*de₃ *maš₂ *PA/u₂-an-ze₂-ŋa₂-ba

At that place where the goat gave (up) the kid,

17': *ki-*ba *dim₃-me-er-*bi *mu-*lu bad-ra₂-<*bi>
  B (10): *ki-*ba dingir-*bi *lu₂ *nu-*me-*en

At the place of that god, there was no one(?), 
Jacobsen: "Treacherous are you, numen of that place"
Falkenstein: "Zum Gott dieses Ortes, dem 'Fernen'"
Roemer: "zum Gott des betreffenden Ortes, dem Fernen(?) hin"

18': <*ŋuruš>-*e *ama-*ŋu₁₀ *sa₂ hu-mu-e *ba-*ni-*in-du₁₁-ga-*še₃
  Note: it is possible that the sign read as "hu" is "ŋa₂".
  B (11a): <*ŋuruš>?-<*e>? *ama-ŋu₁₀ *sa *mu-*me ba-ni-du₁₁-*ga-<zu/še₃>? /
Sign at end of source B looks more like "še₃" than "zu", but it is difficult to determine this with certainty because the edge of the tablet is very eroded and the scribe has squeezed a lot of signs into a small space. For a discussion of the difficulties with "sa mu-me" see Roemer, pp.613-614. Attinger includes this in his list of attestations of the verb sa₂ du₁₁/e, which has the range of meanings "to reach, arrive; to succeed, attain; etc.". On p.646 he translates this line: "Puisse ma mere me rejoindre!". 

At he place where the young man said: "May my mother come to me!",

19': ša₃-ŋu₁₀ gi ir₂-ra edin-na *na-*mu
  Note: in both this line and l.15' "na-mu" is followed by the tablet edge, which is uninscribed. 
  B (11b): *ša₃-*ŋu₁₀ ir₂-ra *edin-na *na-mu-ma-al

My heart wants to play a lamenting reed in the Steppe.

O child-bearing mother - the habitations have been destroyed in the Steppe!
OR: reading "ta" - "O child-bearing mother, what did she lose in the Steppe?"

Jacobsen: "The mother who gave birth, what crushing blow awaits her in the desert?"

Also the sign after "eš" is poorly preserved and mostly broken, making it difficult to determine whether the sign is "še₃". Also, in the first and last verbal forms with ga- it is difficult to determine whether there is an A before AN, but in both instances there is enough space for it, and since am₃ is certain with the second ga- verb, -am₃- is probable for these two forms as well.

Variant sources add: She/I stretched out my/her hand that son in the high steppe /
She/I stretched out my hand for him in the high steppe and the lower steppe
     NOTE: Karahashi cites numerous instances in which shu--bar with the dative means 'to forget', and also notes that the more common meaning of the verb is 'to release'. Unless "release" is to be understood as "leave behind" though, both meanings of the verb seem to make very little sense in the context of this passage, raising the possibility that another action with the hand (stretching out?) is intended here.

  According to collation cited by Katz 2003: 79 n.29 "buluŋ₅" is to be read "hub₂". The verb šu--hub₂ is then argued to mean "ša^ru" 'to whirl' - "in the midst of the kur he was whirling".

Edina Usagake - In the Steppe in the Early Grass

&&VAT 611 + VAT 612 + VAT 1321 = VS 2, 26 (Cohen Source A)
Joins (possibly): VAT 1412 - Note: since it is almost impossible to see how VAT 1412 could physically join with VAT 611+, it is probably better to assume that the two pieces do not belong to the same tablet.
Obverse and reverse (allegedly) mistakenly reversed in VS 2.

Your glistening and shining lamb and calf.

  Note: it is possible that the signs "ru" and "um" are "ša₃" and "ab", but the first sign looks just like "ru" in the previous line (and like the sign after "sur" in l.13), and the second sign looks more like "um" than "ab".

Your young Balag, a wild bull which resounds(?)

Your pure Balag, its ... is shining

13: *ad *gi₄-*gi₄-*zu/ma '' *sur-*RU-*ga-*zu
  Note: the entire beginning of the line is uncertain, since it is possible that the first sign read as "gi₄" is "GAL.HI" and the second sign read as "gi₄" is "maš₂", and it is also not certain whether the sign read as "ma" is "ma" or "zu", since the sign has a small vertical wedge at the top of the sign, which is not present with any of the other "zu" signs in this column.

11: *ŋuruš *gi *za-*gin₃ ŋi₆-par₃-*ta IM-e *ba-*ra
  Note: "si-ig" was almost certainly omitted because the scribe ran out of space at the end of the line since the corresponding line on the reverse continues on to the tablet edge

The wind struck down the young man, the shining reed from the Giparu.

12: imulu₃ nu-me-en-na *im*IM-*ra *nu-*me-*en-*na
J: Since I am one lying in the south winds, lying in all the north winds.

Are you not the south wind, are you not the north wind?

13: di₄-di₄-la₂ *ma₂ *su₃-*su₃ *nu-me-en-na
J: Since I am lying in the little ones that sink the ships.

Are you the little ones sinking the boat?

14: gal-gal *ENxKAR₂! *su₃-*su₃ nu-me-en-na

Are you not the big ones sinking the crops?

15: *gir₂-*gir₂¬ *dal-*ha-*mul nu-me-en-na

Are you not lightning and a whirlwind?

16: ki ŋuruš-*a-*ka na-mu-un-*ma-*al / *a *na-*mu-*un-*di-*la-*he₂
  Note: see the collation drawing for the final sign in the line; it is possible that this is another sign, such as "tum".

Are you not in the place of the young man, are you not water carrying him away?

17: ki {d}dumu-zi-*ka na-mu-un-*ma-*al
J: She should not be where I, Dumuzi, am! Again, she who cries "alas" for me, why does she follow me?

Are you not in the place of Dumuzu?

18: in-ga-*zu!-*zu(OR: da!-ba) *a(-)*a *bi₂-*in-*du₁₁-*ga *a *na-*mu-*un
  Note: again the scribe ran out of space at the end of the line, accounting for the omission of the verbal form. 

Again, the one who cries out alas, she should not ...

19: <*A>?.<*AN>? *sikil? *ga mu!(NUMUN) *e-*ri-*da *ma-*da-*šub-*ba-*da

20: <*igi>-<*ni>-*ta *i₃-*ta-*kar-*ra *na-*ma-*da-*šub-*ba-*da
J: Who in his fleeing before him will take refuge with me!

21: *saŋ-*ŋa₂-*a *tug₂(OR: lu/še₃) *ba-*an-*dul *ma-*da
  Note: "da" is the last sign before the tablet edge, which is uninscribed, making it possible that the scribe anticipated (incorrectly) that the space on the tablet edge would be necessary for completing the corresponding line on the reverse and thus left the rest of the verbal form here blank.

My head is covered with a cloth ...

22: *i-*bi₂-*ne *mu-<*tin> *ŠUB *NE <*du₁₁>-<*ga> / *a-*na *me-<*e> *ma <x> [. . .]
J: He will escape their capture, and in his running he will take refuge with me.

The power of his bound arms ...

26: šu!-ŋu₁₀ *bi₂-*<du₁₁> <*šu>(OR: še₃!) *ba [. . .]
  Note: the sign at the beginning of the line looks a little bit like LAGAB with two Winkelhaken inside it. It is possible though that is simply "šu" written over another sign. 

He said, "my hands!", and the hands ...

27: *saŋ-*ŋu₁₀ *bi₂-*<du₁₁> *TUG₂/ŠE₃ *ba-<*ab> [. . .]

He said, "my head!", ... 

28: *u₂ nu-me-a *u₂ *ga-*an-*da-*ab-<*gaz>? [. . .] 

J: Food which is not food, I want to eat(?) the food with him.

29: *ga nu-me-a *ga *ba-*an-*da-<*gaz> 
Check last sign: Jacobsen's translation assumes that the verb is "ku₂".

J: Milk which is not milk, I want to drink(?) the milk with him.

30: *a *ŋuruš *sikil-*la *sikil-*la *er *ma-*ra-*ma-*ra [. . .]
J: Alas! Woe! Be off! Be off! Go out and away!
Cohen reads el-la el-la instead of sikil-la

Text No. 12: The Creation of the Gala

&&BM 29616 (Kramer, ASJ 3, 1981)

Obv.
1: ša₃-zu ta am₃-ir an-ki ta kuš₂-u₃

What has carried your heart away? What troubles heaven and earth?

2: ama mu-*ŋi₁₇-ib ša₃-zu ta am₃-ir an-ki ta kuš₂-u₃
NOTE: For a list of the different versions of Inana litanies, see Gabbay HES 1: 53-55.
Mother, mistress, what has carried your heart away? What troubles heaven and earth?

3: ga-ša-an-an-na ša₃-zu <ta>? [. . .] ir

Inana, what has carried your heart away? <<What troubles heaven and earth?>>

4: ga-ša-an-e₂-an-na ša₃-zu [. . .] ir

7: ga-ša-an ki unug{ki}-*ga ša₃-zu ta am₃-ir

Lady of Uruk, what has carried your heart away? <<What troubles heaven and earth?>>

8: ga-ša-an ki zabalam{ki} ša₃-zu ta am₃-ir

Lady of Zabalam, what has carried your heart away? <<What troubles heaven and earth?>>

9: ga-ša-an *gi *ni/ir <ama>? *e-*a ša₃-zu ta am₃-ir
NOTE: the restoration is based on the traces of the signs, and the occurrence of the epithet "ama e₂-a" in some Inana litanies - but none of these are preceded by anything resembling the signs "gi" and "ni", so there may be something else here.

Lady ... what has carried your heart away? <<What troubles heaven and earth?>>

10: ga-ša-an tug₂ nu₂?-a ša₃-zu ta am₃-ir

Lady of the ... garment, what has carried your heart away? <<What troubles heaven and earth?>>

11: ga-ša-an tug₂ *gun₃-a ša₃-zu ta am₃-ir

Lady of the colorful garment, what has carried your heart away? <<What troubles heaven and earth?>>

12: ga-ša-an gi du₃-a ša₃-zu ta am₃-ir

Lady of the bound reeds, what has carried your heart away? <<What troubles heaven and earth?>>

13: ga-ša-an *sa la₂-a ša₃-zu ta am₃-ir

Lady of the stretched out net, what has carried your heart away? <<What troubles heaven and earth?>>

14: ga-ša-an ni-nu-a{ki} ša₃-zu ta am₃-ir

Lady of Ninua, what has carried your heart away? <<What troubles heaven and earth?>>

Lady of battle and warfare, what has carried your heart away? <<What troubles heaven and earth?>>

16: ga-ša-an *ŋa₂ gu-la *am₃ ša₃-zu ta am₃-ir

Lady of the large ..., what has carried your heart away? <<What troubles heaven and earth?>>

17: ga-ša-an ib-gal ša₃-zu ta am₃-ir an-ki *ta! kuš₂-u₃

Lady of the Ibgal, what has carried your heart away? What troubles heaven and earth?

18: ša₃ mi-ir-re-a-zu ta am₃-ir

When your heart rages, what has carried <<your heart away? What troubles heaven and earth?>>

19: ša₃ i-zi-<gin₇>? mi-ir-re-a-zu ta am₃-ir

When your heart, like a flood wave, rages, what has carried <<your heart away? What troubles heaven and earth?>>

20: {d}am-an-ki-ke₄ e-ne-eŋ₃-bi ŋiš bi₂-in-tuku / ni₂-te-ni ki <gal>? mi-ni-in-kuš₂-u₃
See Gabbay HES 1: 77-78 for this and the following lines. Gabbay notes that the "gal" is uncertain, and even suggests reading "ki" as a word for "ša₃", which seems unlikely. However, it is true that from the existing photograph, the "gal" is by no means certain.

Enki heard about the matter, he concerns himself with the netherworld(?).

21: gala mu-lu ir₂ ša₃ hun-e-da?-ni? x x mu-na-an-dim₂
NOTE: "-da-ni" seems reasonably certain from the photo - note Gabbay's interpretation: "fashioned for her the gala, her one who calms the heart with laments, from clay(?), restoring the first sign after "ni" as "im" - though this is impossible to confirm from the photo. 

He fashioned for her the gala-official, the one who appeases the lamenting heart ...

22: ir₂ ša₃-ne-ša₄ i-si-iš ma-al-la-ni x x [. . .] bi₂-in-sa₂

He arranged her laments, prayers of compassion and wailing.
Gabbay: He arranged his laments, supplication, and wailing ...

23: kušub li-li-is₃ MUŠ₃-am₃ di-da-ni šu-ni-še₃ bi₂-in-mar
See Gabbay HES 1: 140-142 for a discussion of the instruments in this line.
MUŠ₃-am₃ seems to be the equivalent of Akkadian "ahulap"

Gabbay: "He placed her/his ub and lilis instruments, which utter 'alas!', in his hand.

24: {d}am-an-ki-ke₄ ku₃ ga-ša-an-na-ra mu-lu <*sahar>?-<*ra>? mu-ši-in-gi₄
The two signs after mu-lu are uncertain, Gabbay doesn't propose a reading.

Enki, to pure Inana, sent the one of the dust(?).

25: nin<₉>?-da ša₃-zu he₂-em-hun-e ŋišgu-za-za tuš-*a 
NOTE: Kramer transliterates tuš-u₃, but the photo shows a clear "a" on the tablet.
Gabbay translates: "...Lady! May your heart be calmed! May you sit on your throne!"
Another possibility would be to take -a as the nominalizing element and translate the second part of the line " - the one who is sitting on your throne".

So that he will appease your heart with the lady, sit on your throne(?).
Or: So that he - the one who is sitting on your throne - appease your heart with the lady.

26: *gala-*e *ir₂ *ša₃-[ne-ša₄] <MUŠ₃>? <*am₃>-*di-<*da>? *MI ša₃?-ne?-ša₄? [. . .] ra-ŋal₂
NOTE: the traces are consistent with MUŠ₃, da, and ša₃-ne-ša₄, but in all of these instances, there reading are not completely certain.
This is the last line of this section Gabbay translates, and his translation is similar to mine.

The gala-official, who calls out alas, laments, and supplication, [so that] he ... for you, nightly? supplication.

27: {d} traces lu₂ traces ke₄?

...

28: ŋiš-hur ŋarza(PA.AN) kal?-kal?-la? si ha-ra-ni-*ib-*sa₂

So that the plans and precious(?) rites will be arranged for you there. 

29: [. . .] <*nin>?-ka-si šim lal₃ hab₂-ba šar₂-ra ka-zu-a he₂-em-si
Compare Ninkasi A 14: šim lal₃ ta-hab₂-ba bappir hi-hi-a, which Sallaberger translates: "ein Aroma von weichem Honig, der durchmischte Sauerteig". Civil translates šim ta-hab₂-ba as "dripping with honey". For ta-hab₂ see Attinger 1993, 718-20. Note also that the sign after šar₂ really does look like "ra", though "hi-a" would probably be expected here.

So that <Ninkasi> fills your mouth with the scent of mixed(?) soft honey.

30: [sukkal]-zi-zu ga-ša-an-šubur-ke₄ ša₃-zu he₂-em-hun-e

So that Ninshubur, your true [vizzier] will appease your heart.

31: [mu-ud-na]-zu {d}ama-ušumgal-an-na-ke₄ unug{ki} ma₂ he₂ [. . .]

So that Amausumgal, your spouse Uruk, boat ...

32: [. . .] kar babbar *li-*bi₂-<*du₁₁>?-<*ga>?- <*a>?-*MU i-lu-bi ga [. . .]

... did not ... at the ... white quay ... its lament ...

33: [. . .] ku₃ kar babbar li-bi₂-<*du₁₁>?-<*ga> ?-<*a>?-*MU i-lu-bi ga [. . .]

... the pure ... did not ... at the white quay ... its lament ...

34: kar mah e₂-an-na ab-du₇ ma₂-ŋu₁₀ nu-du₃ [. . .]

Being suited for the majestic quay of the Eanna, my boat, not being built ...

35: kar u₄-šakar(SAR) kar za-gin₃-na li-bi₂-<du₁₁>?-<*ga>?-<*a>?-MU ma₂-ŋu₁₀ mu-e? [. . .]

At the quay of the new moon, the shining quay, did not ... my boat ...

36: bar tug₂-dan₃-na mu₄-ra-am₃ x x x ma-ra mu-e-ze₂-eŋ₃-e

The body, being dressed with a cleaned garment ... he gave to me. 

37: {d}am-an-ki uru-ze₂-ba{ki}-ta kin mu-un-AK-e

Enki will do the work from Eridu.

Text No. 13: Ershemma of Dumuzi

In addition to the source from the Hilprecht collection, BM 61892 and PRAK C 118 duplicate sections of this text, as does NFT 207 (= AO 4331 + AO 4335, collated January 10, 2019), which also has a short section that duplicates a few lines.

PRAK C 118 = Source B
BM 61892 = Source C

&&HS 1494 (TUM 3, 26)
Single column tablet - note that the ductus is fairly cursive and it is entirely possible that this tablet is post-OB, and even Kassite or later.

  NOTE: ZU.AB could be a poorly written "de₂"
  B v 7': en-dara₃-an-na MUŠ₃ <gal>? [. . .]

Endarana, bull, great serpent of the abzu(?)

7': *NINDA₂?i?-*ni-*{d}a *zi *ša₃-*ŋa₂ *balaŋ *kur-*ku *ban₃-*da 
  NOTE: the gloss is written under the first sign, and the first sign of the gloss is uncertain, but the second sign is definitely "da". (NOTE: all the glosses in this source are written directly under the sign). The "ni" and the "da" in the gloss are certain, but the first sign could be "i", "lu", or something else. It is tempting to read NINDA₂in-{d}a, but the sign on the tablet does not look enough like ninda₂ for this to be completely certain.
  B v 8': am-KU/ma zi ša₃-ŋa₂ tur₃ ku₃ banda₃(TUR) 
  NFT 207 (AO 4331 +) rev. i' 1': [. . .] / [. . .] / <*ku₃>? [. . .]
COLLATION NOTE: This is the first preserved line after a long break of at least half of the top half of the tablet. The only preserved sign at the beginning of the line begins with a diagonal wedge, and the most likely possibilities are ku₃, ša₃, or UD. Note the assumption that there were two half-lines before the line with this sign is an assumption, since the tablet is not preserved before this line and it is not possible to determine where the case that ended with this line began. This tablet is written in the same ductus as the other early Isin Period tablets from Girsu.
  C (BM 61892) obv. 1': [. . .] <la>? [. . .]

True ... of my heart, Junior raging harp(Balagkurku banda)

  B v 9': u₃-mu-un ta? {d}nin-lil₂?-le / ab₂-u₂? a su₃-e ba-ab-<x>-a-ri
NOTE: Abu is usually identified as the son of Gula, and occurs frequently in connection with Bau. The connection with Enlil here seems unusual.
 NFT 207 (AO 4331 +) rev. i' 2': *lugal <*{d}>? [x x (x) (x)] / *{d}*AB-<*u₂> [x x (x)] / <*ba>-*ab-<*ga>-<*ri> [(x)]
COLLATION NOTE: It is very probable that the sign after lugal is {d}. The only preserved wedge is a horizontal wedge in the middle of the space for the sign (as opposed to the top or the bottom of the sign), so whatever the sign is must begin with a horizontal wedge in the middle of the beginning of the sign, and this is consistent with {d}. There is enough space after this sign for mu-ul-lil₂¬(-la₂) or en-lil₂(-la₂). The AB sign looks like it could have a Winkelhaken in the bottom right corner of the end of the sign, but this is not certain; the next sign is almost certainly u₂. The bottom left corner of "ba" is damaged, but it is probable that this sign is "ba". The sign "ga" is probable, and there are traces of at least one sign that seems to have a bottom horizontal wedge (the top half of the sign is not preserved) and space for another sign after this before the tablet edge. Note that is not impossible that this sign is "ri", though if this is the case, it is unlikely that it was preceded by "a". Note also that after comparing the traces of this sign to "ri" in the next line "ri" seems almost completely certain. It is also not improbable that the line ended with this sign - note that there are other lines in this column that end with a little space before the tablet edge.
 C (BM 61892) obv. 2': [. . .] a-ri // 3': [. . .] ku₂-a-ri // 4': [. . .] <x> ku₂-a-ri

My friend of Enlil, Abu, who ... laments.

9': *u₃-mu-*un <gu₂>? *ma-*da *sipa *amaš-*a-*na *eŋ₃ *gi-*ra-*ŋu₁₀
  NOTE: the sign read as "erim₃" is probably not "erim₃", but rather a sign that looks more like "am". Note also that it is possible that the sign read as "a" in this line and the next is part of "edin" and not a separate sign.
  B v 10': u₃-mu-un erim₃?-ma?-da sipa amaš-a-na / eŋ₃-gi₄-ra-ri
The phrase u₃-mu-un erim₃-ma occurs as an epithet of Enlil in at least one other text, but the traces of the broken sign in the main source do not really support reading erim₃ here.
  NFT 207 (AO 4331 +) rev. i' 3': *lugal *gu₂ *ma-*da / *sipa *ma-*sa-*ne / *an-*gi-*ra-*ri

11': *maš₂*ma-*aš2 *ni <eŋ₃>?- <AD>? *ma-*re-*si *mu-*lu *edin-*na *u₄ *zal-*zal-*la-*MU
  NOTE: The sign read as "AD" is almost certainly not "AD", but the sign before it could be "eŋ₃". 
  B v 12': meš₃ niŋin₃-ŋar-i₃-si-in{ki} lu₂ edin-na / u₄ zal-la-ri

End of column in AO 4331+, beginning of next column broken. For the remaining collation notes to AO 4331+ see the transliteration of this tablet.

  B v 17': e-lu a-lu-lim lu-lim ama-a-ni ama-a-ni
Seem Krecher ZA 57: 18-19 who cites this and the following two lines as being parallel to BM 78193 (CT 44, 13) obv. 1'f., which begin with the phrase "ama-ni₅ lu-li-ŋu₁₀", which he interprets as "Wehe, mein Hirsch", understanding lu-lim as the word for "deer" and not as an exclamation of pain. If this is the case then this line could be translated: "Woe, deer, deer! his mother, his mother (his mother, his mother who is overcome with suffering, etc.)".

Woe, oh, ah, his mother! his mother!

  B v 21': [. . .] ama ugu-na ŋa₂?-e TE <men₃>?-na
For another occurrence of te-ba in these texts see BM 29631 obv.21-rev.3, with the expression a-ba za-e-gin₇ te-ba, which Falkenstein translates "wer ist wie du" in SAHG 82. Note, however, that the copy of source B has a reasonably clear "ŋa₂" in this and the following two lines, complicating the interpretation of me-a as "where?", and suggesting that a translation like "the mother who bore him, am I indeed to approach", or something along those lines. See also Krecher SKL 78 who cites at least one instance in which me-a may be written for me-e = "I". He also notes that me-a can be translated as either "wie?" or "woher?".

PSD B defines bur-šu-ma as "(a senior servant or official)" and "old woman". References are cited with the latter meaning, where there term occurs with Inana. One of these is from a lament, LB 691 (TLB 2, 1) col. iii 11': bur-šu-ma kur₂-ra i₃-me-en-na šu pe-el-la₂ ba-ab-du₁₁: "because you (Inana) are a hostile old woman, (the shrine) has been profaned". Note also other references though, where the terms occurs in connection with Inana and is followed by "(a-a) {d}en-lil₂-la₂"
Another occurrence of the word in a lament, not cited by PSD, is BM 100059 (unpublished) ii 9': bur-šu-ma e₂ mu-un-ga-ra-na-še₃ nam-mi-ni-ib-ku₄-ku₄: "The old woman does not enter into her treasure house".

Text No. 16: Inana Lament (UA Parallel)

&&YBC 9862 = Unpublished (Cohen Parallel Source C). Tablet collated in New Haven. See also Volk (1989): 46-47 who lists this text together with its OB parallel VAT 1410+ = VS 2, 28 as texts that contain numerous parallels to the parts of tablets 20-21 of the 1st millennium version of Uruamairabi and uses them to illustrate how Versatzstuecke from the OB version are omitted in the later version and how litanies from the OB version are expanded in the first millennium version.
Source B = VAT 1410+ (VS 2, 28). Note that source I = AO 6906 (TCL 16, 69), which is parallel to UA tf. 21: 48f., is also included  here.

Obv.
1: si-gal men₃ si-gal men₃ si kur-ra diri-ga men₃
  B (Obv. 1): [x x x] <x> <x> <*me>-<*en> si kur-ra diri-ga me-en
  Note: it is possible that the first two preserved signs at the beginning of the line are "si-gal", but there are not enough traces to confirm this.

I, the great-horned; I, the great-horned; I, the one whose horns are greater than a mountain.

2: si-gal dingir-*re-*ne men₃ si kur-ra diri-ga men₃

  B (3): [x x (x) (x) (x)] <*a>?-<*nun>-<*na>-<*ke₄>-<*ne> *me-*en
palil = ašaredu = 'foremost'

I, the foremost of the Anuna; I, the one whose horns are greater than a mountain.

4: *sun₂ *zi *ŋa₂-*ŋa₂ a-a {d}<en>-<lil₂>-*la₂ *men₃

I, the true cow who was spawned by Enlil.

5: *sun₂ *zi-*da {d}*mu-*ul-*lil₂-*la₂ men₃ (cf. UA t.21, l.58 and TRS 69 l.11)

I, the true cow of Mulil.
Volk: "Die 'rechte' (Leit-)Kuh Mullils bin ich"

**Commentary:
-- Volk p.235 notes that a close parallel to this line is also found in VAT 7029 = VS 10, 199 rev. iii 24 = u₃ sun₂ zi saŋ-ŋa₂ di-a-ni.

Note: according to copy in B there is only room for one or two signs at beginning of line (which is confirmed by collation).
For mu-tin = zikaru = "man" see especially UA tablet 20: 67-68 where mu-tin and nu-nus forms a pair.

I, the man ... of the rulers.

Note: for this line and the previous line cf. UA tf. 21: 63-64 and TRS 69, 15-16 = H2 k.29 38-39 (cited in Volk 1989: 43-44):

I, the one who stirs up the sediment of the river.

Volk: "Die den Schlamm eines Flusses ..., [bin ich]".

** Commentary:
-- Volk (1989), 237-238 with n.288-289: notes the sahar-ŋar is only one possible reading of IŠ.GAR and he cites Civil Opp. Fs. 78; CAD kuttumu; Krecher SKL 144f.; and Heimpel, Nanshe Hymn = JCS 33: 82 for parallels and discussions of this term.
-- Volk (1989), 238-239 for saŋ-dar: suggest connecting it with Akkadian sakaapu = "to push away" and the verbs Sumerian equivalent gar₃--dar and then proposes that it may mean something like "stir up" = "aufwirbeln" in this context.

I, the lord of heaven; I, the mistress of earth.

12: *i-*bi₂-*ŋu₁₀-<*še₃> <*a>-<*ba>-*am₃ *bar-*ŋu₁₀-*še₃ *a-*ba-*am₃
  In both instances there seems to be another sign before "a-ba-am₃" and in the second instance the sign is definitely "še₃".
  B (obv. 14): [. . .] <am₃> <bar>-<ŋu₁₀>-<še₃> <a> [. . .]
  Note: my collations for this line read: (14) [x x x x] <*a/AN>? '' <*bar>? <x> [. . .]. Since the traces of the sign after "bar"? do not allow for any certain reconstructions, it is possible that this source does not have this line.

Note lines 12-20 are parallel to UA tf. 20: 38-46 (see Volk 1989: 140f. for these lines), note also that many of these lines have Akkadian translations.
1st mill.: i-bi₂-ŋu₁₀-še₃ a-ba-am₃ bar-ŋu₁₀-še₃ a-ba-am₃ = tf. 20 l.38
Akk. ina pa-ni-ya man-nu ina ar-ki-ya ma-an-nu

Who is in front of me? Who is behind me?

**Commentary, Volk pp.167f.:
-- Notes that this passage is a "Versatzstueck" and adds that it corresponds to K 41 iv 5-17 (published in a new copy by Black in ASJ 7, p.77). Note also that for this line K 41 has "-še₃" with "bar-ŋu₁₀".

13: *i-*bi₂-<*il₂> [. . .] <ŋu₁₀> a-<ba>-a *ba-*ra-*e₃
   The sign read as il₂ is far from certain as the tablet is largely broken here. The sign read as "ba" in "a-ba-a" is probable, but also not completely certain. Given the parallels, though, both readings should be maintained.
  B (obv. l.15): [. . .] <*il₂>-*la-*ŋu₁₀ '' *a-*ba-<*a> [. . .]

When I raise my eyes, who is able to escape (them)?

**Commentary, Volk p.168:
-- This line and the next line occur as a pair in many texts. See also SBH 39, rev. 15-16 and SBH 38, obv. 10-11.
-- Volk interprets the Sumerian "i-bi₂-il₂-la-ŋu₁₀" adjectivally as "my raised eyes" instead of as a when-clause, as it is translated in Akkadian.

My collations for this line read 16: [x (x)] <*ra₂>?-*a-*ŋu₁₀ '' *a-*ba-<*a> [. . .]
  The traces of the first preserved sign are consistent with "ra₂(DU)" and there is definitely enough space at the beginning of the line for "a₂ bad".

Note that the sign read as "a₂" is definitely not "du₁₀", as this line appears in the 1st millennium version and at least one OB parallel.

Sum.: When I stretch out the arms, who is able to flee?
Akk. "When I make a wide stride, who is able to flee?"

**Commentary, Volk 168-69:
-- a₂--bad and du₁₀--bad = "Arme weit machen" and "Knie weit machen". For the latter see Sjoeberg ZA 65, 236f. It is likely, though, that both verbs connote running quickly.
-- For a similar line see VS 10, 109 which has du₁₀-bad instead of a₂-bad.

15: *dumu *mah-*di *[. . .] {d}mu-ul-lil₂-*la₂ *men₃
  Possibly traces of one or two signs between "di" and "{d}mu".
  B (17): [. . .] <mah>-di '' {d}mu-<ul> [. . .]
My collations of this line read 17: [x] <*mah>?-*di '' {d}*mu-<*ul> [. . .], where only the end of the top right corner of the sign read as "mah" is preserved, and since these traces could also fit with "di", but since the traces are also consistent with "mah", "mah" can be restored on the basis of the parallel lines in the other sources.

** Commentary, Volk p.169:
-- Note that at this point in the text PRAK C 70, obv. 2-7 are parallel. All of the collations follow those made by Volk in his transliteration of these lines.
-- Notes that this another instance in which Inana calls herself a son of Enlil but explicitly names her father as Suen. Refers to p.154 (tablet 20, l.13) for another further parallels and commentary.

  My collation of this line reads 18: [x] <*a>?-*ŋu₁₀ '' {d}*suen-<*na>? [. . .], where the traces of the sign before "ŋu₁₀" could belong to "a", but this is by no means certain

  My collations of this line read: (Bottom edge): [. . .] <*en> *mi₂ *du₁₁-*ga *{d}*nu-<*dim₂>? [. . .]
--------- note there is single dividing line after this line in source B, also on bottom edge of tablet----------
Note also that there may be traces of another sign (after this dividing line) following the break in the first half of the bottom edge of the tablet which is followed by blank space and then another break at the end of the right half of the tablet which may have also contained signs.
PRAK C 70 4': [. . .] <ša>-an me-en šu du₁₁-ga nu-dim₂-mu-da me-en

**Commentary, Volk p.170:
-- Volk follows the reading mi₂-du₁₁ = kiiniš kunnuu instead of the variant šu--du₁₁, which is apparently discussed by Sjoeberg in ZA 65, 241.

18: *en *mu-*un-*il₂-*en <*u₃>-*mu-*un-*il₂-*en
  Second instance of "il₂" probably not il¬₂, but rather UR or še₈ or a sign like it. Although admittedly the preserved part of the sign looks like the second part of "il₂", if there are traces of another part of a sign before this it is possible that the sign could be "hul". There is also space for possibly one sign between "en" and "u₃"? (another sign which is far from certain)
  B (rev. 1): [. . .] <en>? u₃-mu-<un> [. . .]
My collations of this line read: rev. 1: [x x x x (x)] <*en>? '' *u₃-*mu-<*un> [. . .]
Note: "en" is possible but by no means certain.
PRAK C 70: 5': [. . .] mu-ni-li <u₃>-mu-un mu-ni!-[li]

Akk.: e-na a-na-aš₂-ši šar-ra a-na-aš₂-ši

I install the en-ruler, I install the king.

19: *me-*a-*am?-*ra <aga>? *mu-*na-*ab-*il₂¬-*en
  Traces of at least one and possibly two signs before "mu", but the surface of the tablet is badly damaged here making them almost impossible to read. When looking at the photo the reading "am" for the third sign seems very plausible and there is nothing that would exclude intrepreting the traces of the sign before "mu" as "aga", especially in light of the later parallel.
 B (rev. 2): [. . .] <x> mu-un-na [. . .]
My collations of this line read: rev. 2: [x x] <x> [x x] '' mu-un-<*na> [. . .]

Akk. šar-ra a-ga-a u₂-ša₂-aš₂!(PA)-ši

I cause the crown to be put on the head of the king/shepherd.

**Commentary, Volk p.171:
-- cites MSL 14, p.13, l.11 for the equivalent me-a-am : SIPA : re-iu-u₂-um, citing Wilcke AS 20, p.303 and the TCL 15, 21 catch-line me-a-am-ra me-e mu-<un> [. . .] for this parallel. The translation šarru in the 1st mill. version would also be consistent with this interpretation. It is however unusual that il₂-la is translated with Akk. agu.

20: *sipa-*ra <*mu>-*duru₅ *mu-*na-*ab-<*ze₂>-<*eŋ₃>-*men₃
  B (rev. 3): [. . .] ra mu-dur₂-ru-un mu-un-<na> [. . .]
My collations of this line read: 3: [x (x)] <*ra> *mu-*dur₂-*ru-*un '' mu-un-<*na> [. . .]
Note: the space in the break at the beginning of the line is large enough for "sipa". 
PRAK C 70: 7': [. . .] <pa>?-ra mu-dur₂ mu-un-na-ab-ze₂ [. . .]
1st. mill. sipa-ra mu-du [. . .] mu-un-na-ab-ze₂-eŋ₃-ŋa₂ = tf. 20 l.46
Akk. [. . .] a-nam-din

I cause the scepter to be given to the shepherd.

21: *sipa-*ra *+u₂ *in-<+šu₂>?-*a *mu-*un-*DU.DU-*DU.DU-*e/un?
  It is possible that the sign at the end of the line is "un", but if so it is a bit squeezed and looks more like "e".

I carry ... plants for the shepherd.

22: *u₃-*mu-*un-*e *na-*aŋ₂-u₃-mu-un-*e *mu-*tag-*ge-*en
  B (rev. 4): [. . .] <un>?-e nam-u₃-mu-un <x> [. . .]
My collations of this line read: rev. 4: [x x] <*un>-*e *nam-*u₃-*mu-*un '' <x> [. . .]
  Note: the first "un" seems likely on the basis of the preserved traces.
Although unlikely, it is possible that "tag" is a phonetic writing for "AK", a verb that does sometime occur with nam-en and nam-lugal.

I cause the en-ruler to perform the office of en-ship.

23: *u₃-*mu-*un *hul₂-*la *me-*e *hul₂-*la-*de₃ *men₃
  B (rev. 6): [x x] <*un> [. . .] <*hul₂>?-<*la>?-<*de₃>? [. . .]
  Note: the reading of the signs at the end of the line is very uncertain. For this line and the next line in source B see note below.

The joyful ruler - it is I, who makes him rejoice.

24: ga-ša-an-*e na-aŋ₂-ga-ša-an-*e *mu-*tag-*ge-*en
  B (rev. 5): [. . .] an-e nam-ga-ša-an-e <x> [. . .]
My collations of this line read: 5: [x x] *an-*e *nam-*ga-*ša-*an-*e '' <x> [. . .]

I cause the queen to perform the office of nin-ship.

  B (rev. 7): [(x)]-<*ša>?-*an <*hul₂>?-<*la>? <x> <*hul₂>? [. . .]
  Note: the reading of every sign in this line except "an" is very uncertain.

I, the lady, the joyful queen - it is I, who makes her rejoice.

*******
Note my collations of source B for the line or two lines immediately following the previous line read as follows (rev. l.5 of source B):
6: [x x] <*un>? [. . .] <*un>?-<*ra>? <*na>? [. . .]
7: [(x)]-<*ša>?-*an <x> <mi>? <*ba/KU>? [. . .]
  Note: It looks like the traces in this line, which are from the bottom of signs, are from another line than from the previous line, for which only traces of the tops of signs are preserved; but since the break between the line with the tops of signs and the line with the bottom of signs is due to a join between two separate pieces of the tablet then it is possible (though not likely) that the join in not as wide as the gluing of the two pieces together suggests and that there was only one like here instead of two. 
Since the first half of the first of these lines almost definitely contains "u₃-mu-un" and the first half of the second of the two lines almost definitely contains "ga-ša-an", it seems probable that these lines correspond to lines 23 and 25 respectively. See score above for possible readings of the very difficult to reconstruct traces of these two lines.

See also 246 n.353 where he notes that these seven epithets are parallel to the seven epithets of Enlil discussed by Kutscher in O, Angry Sea. See also 246 n.354 where he notes that the epithet ga-ša-an-e₂-an-na is not always used in this sequence since it is not directly connected to the war-like attributes of Inana. Compares this also to the sequence of Inana epithets in InB 123-132.

**Commentary Volk 250-251: notes that this line and the next are turned into three lines in the later 1st mill. version. He also notes that it is unclear whether "mu-ŋu₁₀" should be understood to be in the accusative or whether it conceals the loc-term element /e/.

-- 251 n.392: Volk expresses uncertainty about whether "MUŠ₂" is to be read "suh" or "muš₂/₃" here noting that "suh" = nasaaqu = "auswaehlen", but that the combination saŋ-suh is otherwise unattested. The first mill. replacement of "saŋ" with "mu" may be a later simplification of the text. 
-- 252: notes that the translation of mu-suh-a-ŋu₁₀ as šu-mi 'my name' (in the accusative) in the later version is based on a collation by Black which revealed that the text does not have "ana šu-mi-ya" 'at the naming of my name'.

**Commentary Volk 252-253: notes that both OB version and later Akkadian translation leave out gin₇/kiima. He also cites parallels to Inana and the verb ni₂--dub₂ = 'to rest'. For a discussion of this verb he cites SKL pp.139f. and notes the parallel in Inninshagura l.115 = te-en-te-en ni₂-dub₂-bu-de₃ translated "ta-ne-eh-tum u₃ šu-up-šu-hu!-um" 'Beruhigung und zur Ruhe bringen'.

**Commentary Volk p.253: Note that the tigi ku₃ is one of the "me" of Inana in Inana and Enki (Farber-Fluegge 114f.) and he cites col. iv l.48 from this text as a partial parallel: tigi₂ niŋ₂-du₁₀-ge si he₂-em-mi-ib-sa₂-sa₂ = "Tigi-Trommeln, die einen guten (Klang) besitzen, moege er anstimmen lassen".
-- Also notes the problem with -ra- in the verbal chain in both the OB and later sources. Dative "for you" would make little sense here, especially in light of the 1cs singular possessive suffix with "tigi₂". 

13 (44): *a-*ba *mu-*da-*ab-*še-*ge *ma-*da
LV 92: a-ba mu-un-da-ab-si₃-ge e-ma-da = tf. 21 l.93
Akk. man-nu u₂-maš-ša₂-lu ia-ti

Who can measure up to me?

**Commentary Volk p.253: notes that this line and the following line (along with two additional lines that are only attested in the later 1st mill. version) are identical to the first four lines of tf. 21 and the last four lines of tf. 21, which are identical to the first four lines and form a "frame" for the content of the entire tablet.
-- Volk p.207 has philological commentary to this line and the next: notes that ma-da seems to be the earlier form of the form e-ma-da = "with me". He also understands še-ge to be a writing of si₃-ge which is semantically parallel to "sa₂" in the next line. This interpretation is also supported by the Akkadian translation of the line.
-- p.207: for si₃-ge = mašaalu/muššulu see Sjoeberg ZA 65: 218f. in the commentary to Inninshagura 53, which use the verb in a parallel context.

14 (45): *a-*ba *mu-*da-*ab-*sa₂-*e *ma-*da
LV 93: a-ba mu-un-da-ab-sa₂-a e-ma-da = tf. 21 l.92
Akk. man-nu i-ša₂-an-na-an-ni ia-ti

Who is comparable to me?

Note that 1st mill. version has one more line not in OB version and after that it is the end of tablet 21 of UA.
15: *ki-*ru-*gu₂ *19-kam-ma
   Note that this rubric is squeezed under the preceding line without a dividing line

It is the 19th Kirugu.

16 (46): *u₄ *mu-*un-*zu-*a-*e *kur-*re *mu-*un-*kuš₂-*u₃

The one who know the storm concerns herself with the mountain,

17 (47): *ama *mu-*gi₁₇-*ib *u₄ *mu-*un-*zu-*a-*e kur-re <*mu>-<*un>-<*kuš₂>-*u₃
   There are appear to be traces of at least one or even two signs before "kuš₂" at the end of the line. 

Mother, mistress, the one who knows the storm, concerns herself with the mountain.

18 (48): kur-re mu?-un?-ga?-bi? mu-un-kuš₂-u₃
  The signs in this line - if they are on the tablet at all - are hardly visible and are written in very small signs below the previous line as if inserted later.

She concerns herself with the precious possessions of the mountain.

19 (49): *kur-*re *gi₁₆-*sa-*bi? *mu-*un-*kuš₂-*u₃

She concerns herself with the treasure of the mountain.

20 (50): *kur-*re *NIM{ki}-ma *mu-*un-*kuš₂-*u₃
NOTE: there is a temptation, in light of the later parallel lines, to understand NIM{ki}-ma as a form of nim-ma = "upper", i.e., as a spatial designation that is the counterpart of hu-bu-ur₂, which in the later translation is understood to mean "lower", but the forms are difficult.

She concerns herself with the mountain, in Elam.

21 (51): *NIM{ki} *hu?-*bu-*ur₂-*ra mu-un-kuš₂-u₃
  Cohen reads a "hu" before "bu", but the sign is definitely not on the tablet, unless the sign that looks more like "ma" or "du" is "hu", which seems unlikely. In favor of reading hu-bu-ur₂, however, compare SBH 9, rev.45-56 = SBH 10, rev. 25-26, which seem to be directly parallel to this line and the next, and which read:
  45: nim-ma ki hu-bu-ru-a im <<>>
     Akk. ša₂ e-liš u šap-liš MIN
  46: dubur an-gi₁₆-gi₁₆-a im <<>>
     Akk. i-šit-tum ANe it-gu-ru-tu₄
In later texts nim-ma and ki-ta are translated with eliš and šapliš, but the significance of hu-bu-ur₂ is unclear, and seems to have been left untranslated in SBH 9 and 10.

She concerns herself with what is in lower Elam.

22 (52): dubur₂ *an-*gi₁₆-*gi₁₆-*le *mu-un-kuš₂-u₃
  The signs read as "gi₁₆" are reasonably certain, but there is definitely not a "ki" before the verbal form. The absence of "ki" was also confirmed from the photo of the tablet.
For the image dubur₂ an-gi₁₆-gi₁₆-le see Alster RA 85: 9f. and Cavigneaux JAOS 113: 254 - possibly refers to a mountaneous horizon, or as Cavigneaux suggests, the illusion of moving lines created by mountains in the foggy distance. The image also occurs in Inana and Shukaletuda 115 et passim.

She concerns herself with the intertwined horizon.

23 (53): *uru₂ *zi-*da *u₄ *mu-*un-*zu-*a-*e <*kur>-<*re> *mu-*un-*kuš₂-*u₃

The one who know the storm in the true city concerns herself with the mountain.

24 (54): *ša₃-*ba-*ni <*kuš₂>-*u₃
Compare source B (rev. l.17 - last line on tablet): [. . .] ša₃-ba-ni <kuš₂>?-<u₃>? [. . .]

She is concerned.

---- double dividing line on tablet ----
Colophon: *ki-*šu₂-*bi *balaŋ *{d}*inana-*kam
------------ single dividing line follows ------
traces of two or three signs practiced in empty space that follows, one of these looks like "u₂", another two, below and to the left, look like DIŠ followed by "ma"

It is the conclusion. Balag of Inana.

&&VAT 1410 + (VS 2, 28)
Note that this source contains numerous parallels to lines from the OB source YBC 9862 as well as to lines from tablets 20 and 21 of the 1st millennium version of Uruamairabi.  For these parallels, see Volk (1989) 46-47 and transliteration of Source A = YBC 9862.
This source is a small, single column tablet (9.2cm in height, 6.7cm in width). Note that (very minor) additional collations to this source, which are not included here, were made after these lines were transferred to the score of YBC 9862 below - see the score for these additions.
Obv.
1: [x x x] <+si>? <+gal>? <*me>-<*en> si kur-ra diri-ga me-en = YBC 9862 obv. 1
  Note: it is possible that the first two preserved signs at the beginning of the line are "si-gal", but there are not enough traces to confirm this.

I, the great-horned; I the great-horned; I, the one whose horns are greater than a mountain.

2: [x x x x (x)] <*dingir>-*re-*e-*ne me-en

  YBC 9862 obv. 3: palil {d}a-nun-ke₄-ne men₃ si kur-ra diri-ga men₃
NOTE: given the space between the space between the first and second parts of each line in the following lines on the tablet, it is not unlikely that there were only one or two signs written in the break in the first half of the line, making palil(ŠI.DU) a possibility.

I, the [foremost one?] of the Anuna.

4: [x x] '' *bara₂-*bara₂-*ke₄-*ne me-en
  YBC 9862 obv. 6: mu-tin še-er zi? e₁₁? bara₂-bara₂-ke₄-ne men₃
NOTE: there is space for a maximum of two signs in the break at the beginning of the line, making it impossible that the beginning of this line was identical to the first half of l.6 in YBC 9862.

I, the ... of the rulers.

5: <*alim> *kur-*ra '' *si *gur₃-*ru me-en = YBC 9862 obv. 7

NOTE: there is enough space in the break for me-e dingir, but not for me-e dim₃-me-er.

I [am indeed] the one who is greater than all the gods (for him) (?)  

9: [x x] <*na>-ke₄-ne '' mu-un-na-diri-ge

My raised hand reaches to the heavens.

11: [x] <*+il₂>-*la-*ŋu₁₀ '' *ki-*e ba-e-us₂
  Note: the traces of the "il₂" are consistent with the second part of "gur₃" in l.5, so "il₂" is certainly possible.
  YBC 9862 obv. 27: me-ri il₂-la-ŋu¬₁₀ ki-a ba-ab-us₂

My raised foot touches the earth.

NOTE: "ŋu₁₀" "še₃" and "a" are not really visible from the photo, but they are supported by the traces of these signs drawn in the hand copy.

[Who] is [in front of me]? Who is behind me? 

15: [x] <*il₂>-*la-*ŋu₁₀ *a-*ba-<*a> [. . .]

NOTE, however, that this dividing line may simply be a line ruling.

  YBC 9862 obv. 18: en mu-un-il₂-en u₃-mu-un <<mu-un->>il₂-en
NOTE: in YBC 9862, the end of the line could be an instance of haplography where the scribe omitted the -mu-un of u₃-mu-un because of the mu-un- at the beginning of the verbal form. In support of this, note that there is more than enough space in the broken part of the end of the line in VAT 1410+ for "mu-un-il₂-en".

I install the ruler, I install the king.

2: [x x] <x> [x x] '' mu-un-<*na> [. . .]
  YBC 9862 obv. 19: me-a-am?-ra aga? mu-na-ab-il₂-en

[I cause the crown to be put on the head of the king/shepherd] for him.

  YBC 9862 obv. 20: sipa-ra mu-duru₅ mu-na-ab-ze₂-eŋ₃-men₃

[I give] the staff to [the shepherd].

4: [x x] <*un>-*e *nam-*u₃-*mu-*un '' <+mu> [. . .]
  Note: the first "un" seems likely on the basis of the preserved traces. The same holds true for "mu" at the end of the line.
  YBC 9862 obv. 22: u₃-mu-un-e na-aŋ₂-u₃-mu-un-e mu-tag-ge-en  

[I cause the] en-ruler [to perform] the office of en-ship.

  YBC 9862 obv. 23: u₃-mu-un hul₂-la me-e hul₂-la-de₃ men₃

[The joyful] ruler - [it is I, who makes him rejoice].

7: [(x)]-<*ša>?-*an <+me>?-<+en>? <ga>?-<*ša> [. . .]
  Note: It looks like the traces in this line, which are from the bottom of signs, are from another line than from the previous line, for which only traces of the tops of signs are preserved; but since the break between the line with the tops of signs and the line with the bottom of signs is due to a join between two separate pieces of the tablet then it is possible (though not likely) that the join in not as wide as the gluing of the two pieces together suggests and that there was only one like here instead of two. 
  YBC 9862 obv. 25: ga-ša-an men₃ ga-ša-an hul₂-la me-e hul₂-la-de₃ men₃
I, the lady, [the joyful] queen - [it is I, who makes her rejoice].

... the ruler ...

10: [. . .] '' <*+sa/e₂>-*<a> <x> [. . .] <*me>-*en
  Note: the sign end of the sign read as "sa" is broken so it is not possible to determine whether there was a final vertical wedge, and since three horizontal wedges are preserved inside of the sign and "e₂" in l.7 does not have any horizontal wedges, it is likely (though not certain) that this sign is "sa" instead of "e₂".

I, ...

11: [. . .] <x>? [. . .] <x>?
  Note: *there is not a double or single dividing line on the tablet after this line, but since l.10 is almost completely broken, and it is not certain that there are any traces of any signs in the preserved parts of the line, it is not clear whether there were any signs in this line. Note, however, that the width of the line is exactly the same as that of the other lines on the tablet, making it likely that there was a line and not a blank space here.

...

12: [x (x)] <*ša>?-*an-*na [(x)] '' *gu₃ <*mu>-<*ni>-<*ib>-be₂
  Note: the traces of the end of the sign before "an" are consistent with the end of "ša" on this tablet, though the end of "NE" is equally possible, and given the parallels with the following lines, seems more likely.

Inana(?) spoke:

13: <*e>-<*ne>-eŋ₃ an gu-la-*ke₄ '' u₄-de₃ *an-*na *gu₃ mu-ni-*ib-*be₂

She spoke the word of great An to the storm in the sky.

14: *e-*ne-*eŋ₃ {d}mu-ul-lil₂-*la₂-*ke₄ *u₄-*de₃ an-na gu₃ mu-<*ni>!-ib-be₂

She spoke the word of Enlil to the storm in the sky.

When she spoke the word in the storm of the sky,

16: <ša₃>? <x> <x> <x> <*ba>-*dub₂-<<*dub₂ erased>> *ki *bi₂-*sig₃!(BA)-*sig₃
   Note: for the signs at the beginning of the line see the collation drawing; the second "dub₂" was definitely erased by the scribe.
She made the ... shake, she made the earth tremble.

17: <*kul>-*aba₄*{ki} <x> <x> <*ba>-*dub₂-*dub₂ *ki *+bi₂ <<*+BA>>-*+sig₃-*+sig₃

Text No. 17: Another Inana Lament

&&BM 16385 (CT 42, 14) - Note: no collation photos. Not photographed by me or Anna, and the BM and CDLI websites do not have it up. Also, the translation of all but the obvious passages is extremely tentative. The text is not included in Fritz's survey even though it is clearly about Inana and Dumuzi.

Obv.
1: [ŋa₂?]-e im-ma-al-e KA bi₂-in-DU(-)KA <NE> [. . .]

I, the cow, speak(?) ...

2: <nu>-gig an-na ga-ša-an-an-na [men₃]

I, the mistress of heaven, Inana,

3: kur gul-gul ga-ša-e₂-an-na men₃
NOTE: copy has nu, but Kramer's collation (JCS 18) reveals that the sign is KUR. 

I, the destroyer of the lands, lady of the Eanna,

4: an dub₂-ba ga-ša-an-ŋi₆-par₃-ra men₃
NOTE: copy has lu, but Kramer confirms that the sign is ra.

I, the one who makes the heavens shake, the lady of the Gipar.

5: lu₃?-lu₃-na ga-ša-an-tur₃-amaš-a men₃
NOTE: Kramer JCS 18: 44 n.70 suggests that lu₃-lu₃-na is a variant writing of lil₂-la₂-en-na, which is the word that precedes ga-ša-an-tur₃-amaš in the Inana litany in NCBT 688 obv. 7.

6: a-še-er e₂ uru₂!-a mu-un-ma-ma?-ma
NOTE: even though Kramer does not include a collation note here, it is tempting to read the verbal form "ma-ma-al". The same holds true for e₂ uru₂-a, which is written e₂ e-a on the tablet in this and the following lines.
She laments in/for the temple and city.

7: a-še-er dam-an-ne₂ e₂ uru₂-a bi₂-in-du₁₁

She laments for her spouse in the temple and the city.

8: a-še-er du₅-mu-ni e₂ uru₂-a bi₂-in-du₁₁

She laments for her son in the temple and the city.

9: saŋ ŋi₆-a gu₃-ni ma-ra-ra-ra

She raises her voice for the black-headed ones.

10: (10-mark left edge) e₂ hul-an-na in-ga-am₃-du₁₁

She speaks of her destroyed temple.

11: <uru₂> ir₂-ra-an-na in-ga-am₃-du₁₁

She speaks of her lamentable city.

12: ga-ša-an-an-na e₂-tur₃ gul!-la!-an-na ab₂ sag₂-du₁₁-bi an-na

Inana (speaks of) her destroyed cattle-pen, of her cows scattered from it.

13: ga-ša-an-an-na ki(-)ga-nam HUL?-an-na e-ze₂-gin₇ bu-ra an-na

Inana (speaks of) her ... , of her ... which were torn out like sheep (from it).

14: <x> <x> an-na mar-mar-an-na

...

15: ga-ša-an-an-na mu-lu a-še-er gig-ga a-še-er-zu ŋi₆-a bi₂-mar

Inana, one who bitterly laments, laments for you in the night.

16: ga-ša-an-an-na a-še-er-zu gig-ga gu₃ de₃-ni-ma-ma (OR: šud₃-de₃ i₃-ma-ma)
NOTE: Kramer suggests that KA in this and the following lines might be šud₃(KAxŠU). If this is the case, then the verbal forms would have to be read "šud₃-de₃ i₃-ma-ma", and the translation would have to be changed accordingly (in this line) to "Inana, your lament is proclaimed in supplication bitterly". 

Inana, I want to cry out your lament bitterly.

17: gu₃ de₃-ni-gid₂ e₂ i₃-ma-ma gu₃ de₃-ni-ma-ma

I want to ..., ..., I want to cry out.

18: a-še-er šud₃-de₃ e-ne-eŋ₃-zu sizkur₂ gu₃ de₃-ni-ma-ma
NOTE: the signs in the copy look more like GAZ.GAZ than sizkur₂.

Lamenting, prayer, your word, I want to call out (and) sacrifice (?)

19: si-mul-an-na mu-ni-ma-ma gu₃ de₃-ni-ma-ma

I place a shining horn in the sky, and I want to call out to it.

20: (10-mark) e₂-ŋu₁₀ e₂ lul-<la> ma <du₃>-a-ŋu₁₀ ama-ŋu₁₀ i₃-ma-ma 
NOTE: lines which are similar to this line and the next occur in the unpublished Inana Ershemma, BM 23696, rev. 18-19, which read: ma-ra e₂ lul-la e₂ du₃-a ama lul i₃-me-en-na <<blank space>> // ma-ra uru₂ lul-la e¬₂ du₃-a ama lul i₃-me-en-na <<blank space>>

My house, my house which was built as a house of lies, my mother calls out(?) in it.
Kramer (JCS 18: 44-45 n.71 translates: "Oh my house which has been made into a house of deceit, my mother, she pleads", which assumes that šud₃-de₃ is to be understood between ama-ŋu₁₀ and i₃-ma-ma.

21: uru₂!-ŋu₁₀ uru₂!(E₂) lul-<la> mu-un-ŋar(-)ga-a-ŋu₁₀ ama-ŋu₁₀ i₃-ma-ma

My city, which was established as a city of lies, ... my mother calls out(?) in it.

22: AŠ nam-tar <di/ki>-na <du₃>?-a-ŋa₂ ama-ŋu₁₀ i₃-ma-ma

In my ... fate ... my mother calls out.

23: a-<ra>-aš₂ AŠ?.SI? na-ma-ŋin-na-a-ŋa₂ ama-ŋu₁₀ i₃-ma-ma

In my ... my mother calls out.

24: i-ti-im-gi-na la?-ba-an-im?-gi-na-gin₇ ama-ŋu₁₀ i₃-ma-ma
NOTE: Kramer understand i-ti-im as a phonetic writing for GA₂xMI = itima 'sleeping chamber'. See Mittermayer ELA 269-270 for a recent discussion of the term, which she translates "Privatgemach". Since itima has a k-Auslaut, "gi" may be a phonetic writing for it. 

Like one who ... in her private chamber, my mother calls out.

25: <x>-ma inim nu-mu-ni-ib-gi-a-gin₇ ama-ŋu₁₀ i₃-ma-ma

Like one who does not reply in ..., my mother calls out.

26: ama-ni <UŠ>?.TUG₂? mu-un-na-da-gub e-ne-eŋ₃ mu-ni-ib-gi₄-gi₄
  Kramer (JCS 18: 45 n.72) reads: ama-ni x-x mu-un-na-da-gub etc. and translates: "Her mother ... steps up to her, gives answer to her.
 
Her mother paid heed to her(?), she replied to her:

27: za-e ni₂-zu an-ne₂ ba-<DI>-<e> <a>-<na>? <ba>?-ni-AK-ke₄
  Kramer (JCS 18: 45 n.73) reads: za-e ni₂-zu an-ne₂ ba-DI-e a-na-gin₇ i₃-AK-ke₄ and translates: "You compare(?) yourself to An, how is it that you act thus?".

You ... yourself to An/the sky, what are you doing?

28: ga-ša-an-an-na ni₂-zu šul-la-a-<zu>? a-na-aš ba-da-<aŋ₂>?-<e/ke₄>
NOTE: the signs for the verb in this line and the next are identical, and while "AK" is unlikely, aŋ₂ or il₂ are both possible. If the former, then maybe "aŋ₂" is a phonetic writing for AK? Against this possibility is the occurrence of the verb aŋ₂ with ba-da- in other texts. But it also seems unlikely that AK would be written with a ŋ-Auslaut.

Inana, in your ... yourself, why are you ...?

29: <nin/dam>-<e>? a-gin₇ <la>?-la KAL-bi a-gin₇ a-na [. . .] <x> <x>-aŋ₂-<e/ke₄>

Lady(?), how is that ..., why do act(?) thusly?

30: (10-mark) unu₂(TE.UNUG) suba(ZA.MUŠ₃) la₂ mu-hul?-<bi>? [. . .]
The phrase unu₂ suba occurs frequently in connection with Inana - see, for example, Abzu Pelam l.13, with one source with an Akkadian translation of the phrase.

Suspended suba-ornament ...

31: maš₂! u₈!-da {d}mar-tu [. . .]

NOTE: it is possible that il-lum is a phonetic writing for ildum₂ = "band, assembly", and refers to a band of demons that have seized Dumuzi, but this is very uncertain and probably unlikely. But Kramer's suggestion that this is a phonetic writing for e-lum 'honored one' is even better.

Text No. 18 - Another Inana Lament 2

&&BM 23117 (CT 15, p.24-25)

Obv.
beginning of obverse broken
NOTE: the entire first section of the text seems to duplicate VAT 609+ (VS 2, 25) col. viii 42f. (see Krecher's commentary to these lines in SKL 214f. for these lines and further parallels to them). The other parallels to some of these lines include:
  -- BM 29615 (CT 15, 7) obv. 20f.
  -- VAT 1423 (VS 2, 19) obv. 1f.
  -- K.2881+2786 rev. 31f. (for many of these lines see Black ASJ 7: 24f. (l.231f.) 
The second preserved section of this text is translated by Falkenstein SAHG 183f. as a "Klagelied Inannas", but the close parallels between the first section of the text and Ninisina laments with the same lines suggest that this is a lament to Ninisina and not Inana; but the parallels to Asher Gita are equally indicative of Inana and almost suggest a merging of the two deities, or the appropriation of Ninisina's attributes by Inana. The entire section of the text is also transliterated by Black as a parallel source to Asher Gita in ASJ 7: 72f. - this transliteration includes collations. The lines in this section are very closely parallel to Asher Gita l.231f. in Black's edition.

1': [e₂?-a nu-mu-un-til₃-en ŋa₂-la nu]-<mu>-[un-til₃-le-en] = VAT 618+ col. viii l.42

I live without a house, I live without property.

2': [dam-ŋu₁₀ nu-mu-un-til₃-en] <dumu>? nu-mu-[un-til₃-en]

I do not live with a wife, I do not live with a son.

3': [i₃-niŋin-de₃-en] <i₃>-šu₂-šu₂-[de₃-en]

I roam about, I sink down

4': [gud₃ gig-ga-bi] u₄ šu₂-a [men₃]
NOTE: given the occurrence of men₃ for me-en in l.10', me-en should probably be restored -men₃ in this and the following lines.

I am one whose nest is bitter at the darkening of the day.

5': [šilam amar-bi] ni₁₀-ni₁₀-<na> [men₃]

I am a wild cow who wanders around (lost) with its calf.

6': [ga-ša-an me-en mu-lu im₂-ma] uru₂-a ku₄-[ra men₃]

I, the lady, am a runner, I am one who enters the city.

7': <dilmun>{ki} <sug>-<ga> <ŋiš>ma₂ su-a [men₃]

I am (a merchant from) Dilmun whose boat is sunk in the marsh.

8': <šu>-ku₆ ambar-ra ma₂ niŋin₂-na [men₃]
  BM 29615 obv. 27: šu-ku₆ ambar-ra ba-an-niŋin-na me-en
 
I am a fisherman whose boat circles around the marsh.

9': <uru₂>-ŋa₂ ur-re men₃ sila-ŋa₂ KAS₄ [men₃]
  NOTE: KAS₄ = gir₅, the same word that occurs at the beginning of the lament, "The Messenger and the Maiden". See Katz 2003: 79 n.27 for more references.

I am an enemy in my city, I am a stranger in my street,

10': <ki>-ulutim₂(SIG₇.ALAN) e₂ ama ugu-ŋa₂-ka e₂-ur₅-ra-[bi] <men₃>

In my birthplace, in the house of the mother who bore me, I am a debtor.

11': lipiš i₃-ma-al a₂ nu-ma-al men₃

I am one who has courage, but does not have strength.

12': egi₂ men₃ ama₅-ŋa₂ lipiš nu-ma-al-la men₃

I, the princess, I am who does not have courage in my own private chamber.

13': e-ne-eŋ₃-ŋa₂-ni ba-da-ul₄-e-en-na di in-ga-mu-ub-du₁₁ / 27 i-bi₂ E₂?.ŠA? i-ni-ib-du₈
  NOTE: this line is not parallel to any lines in the sources with the previous section of the text. BM 29615 obv. 32 reads: u₃-mu-un-na e-ne-eŋ₃-ŋa₂-ni na-ma-da-te mu-lu-da-ni ma-te

When I hasten toward his word, he speaks a judgement and looks at ...
 
------- double dividing line on tablet --------
14': u₄-ba gi₁₆-le-eŋ₃-men₃-na-ŋu₁₀ u₄-ba me-li-e-a

At that time when I was destroyed, at that time there was woe.

15': balaŋ-di u₄-ba gi₁₆¬-le-eŋ₃-men₃-na-ŋu₁₀ u₄-ba me-e-li-e-a

At that time when I was destroyed, may Balag-performer (pronounced) woe at that time.

16': u₄ e-ne-eŋ₃ an-na ma-i-ir-a-bi

At that time when that word of An seized me,

17': e-ne-eŋ₃ {d}mu-ul-lil₂-la₂ ma₂-ra i-ir-a-bi

18': e₂-ŋu₁₀-a mu-ši-in-ŋin-na-ba

When they (the word of An and Enlil) came into my house.

When somebody came into (my) house.

23': (10-mark) mu-<lu> kuše-sir₂-ŋa₂ i-ni-in-ku₄-ra-ba

When somebody stepped into my shoes.

24': šu nu-luh-ha-ni <x> [. . .] <i₃>?-ir-ra-ba

When somebody with impure hands plundered [me].

25': zi-ga u₅-a ba [. . .] a-ba

When I rose up and boarded [a boat?]

end of obverse

Rev.
1: ma-an-ga ma₂ saŋ-ŋa₂ [. . .]
  -- Compare Jaques (Attinger Fs. p.198) who translates ma-an-ga as "possessions" (in parallel with gi₁₆-sa = 'treasure') and cites the occurrence of this word in the Uruamairabi tablet published by Volk in BagM. 

The possessions on my head boat ...

2: ga-ša-an-bi ma₂ egir-ra ba-e-u₅-a-ba

When I, its lady, boarded the back of the boat.

3: ni₂-te UL-a-bi ba-e-te-a-ba

When I, one my own, approached its ...

4: ur-re me-ri kuše-sir₂ ma-al-la-ni ama₅-ŋa₂ mi-ni-in-ku₄

The enemy who put his feet in my shoes entered my private chamber.

5: ur-re-bi šu nu-luh-ha-ni ma-še₃ mu-ši-in-ir-ir

That enemy whose hands were impure seized me.

6: šu mu-ši-in-ir ni₂ mu-un-te-ŋe₂₆e ni₂-bi ma-te
NOTE: for a discussion of the syntax and meaning of ni₂--te see Jaques 2006: 195f.

He seized me, he terrified me and I was afraid.

7: ur-re-bi šu-ni mu-ši-in-ir me-da mu-un-GAM-men₃
  -- Compare Jaques in Attinger Fs. p.196, who cites the contrast between "ir" and "ga(m)", which she argues to be parallel to "de₆/tum₂" - she also cites that Akkadian translations of these verbs in the 1st mill. parallel source PSBA 17, pl.1 i 11'-12' where ir = Akk. u₂-ub-lam-ma and -gam = uš-mi-tan-ni ('he makes me die (of fear)'). gam is taken to mean 'to tear out', 'lead away with force', etc. in these contexts.

This enemy seized me and he carried me away (OR: he threw himself on me).

8: (10-mark) ur-re-bi ŋa₂-<e> ni₂ ba-da-an-te e-ne nu-mu-da-an-te

This enemy terrified me, but he was not afraid.

9: ur-re-bi tug₂-ŋu₁₀ mu-un-kar dam-a-ni ba-ni-in-mu₄

This enemy took away my garment and dressed his wife with it.

10: ur-re-bi za-ŋu₁₀ mu-un-ku₅ dumu-ni ba-ni-in-la₂

This enemy cut off my precious gem stone and he hung it on his son.

11: ki-gub-ba-bi am₃-zukum-me
For this line and the next, see also BM 98396 rev. 2-3 which has an identical pair of lines.

There where he stood I had to tread.

12: dim₂-ma ni₂-ŋa₂-še₃ ki am₃-ši-kin-kin

He reads my terrified mind.

13: u₄-ba ni₂ ba-te šu e₃-ta <na>-e₃
At that time I was terrified, unable to escape his hand.

14: e₂-ŋa₂ ba-an-ul₄-le-en e₂-gar₈-ŋa₂ ba-ab-hu-luh-e

I hastened into my house and I was terrified inside my walls.

15: tumušen ni₂ te-a-gin₇ ŋišur₃-ra u₄ ba-e-zal

Like a terrified dove, I passed the day on the roof.

16: su-dinmušen dal-la-gin₇ habrud-de₃ al-gi-re

Like a fleeing bat, I took refuge in a nook.

17: me-e e₂-ŋu₁₀-da mušen-gin₇ im-ma-ra-dal-en

I, myself, fled like a bird from my own house!

18: (10-mark) ga-ša-an men₃ uru₂-ŋu₁₀-da mušen-gin₇ im-ma-ra-dal-en

I, the lady, fled like a bird from my own house!

19: egir-ŋu₁₀ a e₂-ŋu₁₀ egir-ŋu₁₀-a gu₃ mu-un-de₂-de₂-e
Black interprets this and the following lines as: "He kept shouting after me in my own house" - a translation that is consistent with the 1st millennium Akkadian translation of these lines, but the Sumerian is also different in the later version in way that allows this translation. Nonetheless, the possibility should be kept open that the enemy is speaking to Inana here.

I called out behind me: "Woe my house, behind me!" 

20: egi₂ men₃ uru₂-ŋu₁₀ egir-ŋu₁₀-a gu₃ mu-un-de₂-de₂-e

I, the princess, called out behind me: "(Woe) my city!"

21: še-eb i₃-si-in{ki}-ŋu₁₀ egir-ŋu₁₀-a gu₃ mu-un-de₂-de₂-e

I called out behind me: "My brickwork, Isin!"

22: eš₃ e₂-gal-mah-ŋu₁₀ egir-ŋu₁₀-a gu₃ mu-un-de₂-de₂-e

I called out behind me: "My shrine, the Egalmah!"

23: še-eb la-ra-ak{ki}-ŋu₁₀ egir-ŋu₁₀-a gu₃ mu-un-de₂-de₂-e

I called out behind me: "My brickwork, Larak!"

24: ŋi₆-par₃ imin-ŋu₁₀ egir-ŋu₁₀-a gu₃ mu-un-de₂-de₂-e

I called out behind me: "My ... Gipar!"

25: me-e e₂-ŋu₁₀ e₂-ŋu₁₀ nu-me-en a-gin₇ in-na-du₁₁

I said to him: "How is it that my house, my house is no more!"

26: me-e uru₂-ŋu₁₀ uru₂-ŋu₁₀ nu-me-en a-gin₇ in-na-du₁₁

I said to him: "How is it that my city, my city is no more!"

27: na-an-ni-ku₄-ku₄-de₃ um-mi-du₁₁ a-la-bi mu-ku₂-e
NOTE: for this and the following line see Jaques 2006: 267-68 + n.553 with references to further discussions by Attinger and Krecher. The verb šara(g) = unnušu "to weaken; to humiliate" as well as "to dry up, drain, diminish", etc.

After I said, "I will never enter it again", its allure consumed me.

28: <na>-<eŋ₃>-da-ŋa₂-ŋa₂-de₃ um-mi-du₁₁ <i>-si-iš-bi mu-ša-ra-<ge>

After I said, "I will never touch it again", its joyfulness devoured me. 

29: [a-gin₇ i₃-gul a-gin₇ i₃-gul-gul] <ni₂>-<zu> <a>-<gin₇> [mu-un-pe-el]
NOTE: the restoration is based on the parallel line in the later version of the passage.

How can it be destroyed, how is it destroyed, how is it that your own dwelling is defiled?

Text No. 19: Lament to Inana as Ningirgilu

Ershemma to Ningirgilu (who has her own shrines and temples in the Ur III and OB periods, but in later lexical lists is equated with Inana, and in this text is almost directly identified with her.

&&BM 23584 (CT 42, pl.23)

Obv.
1: UL-e pa-pa-al-ta '' ir₂ am₃-da-<*ni>-[še₈-še₈]
  Note: traces of last preserved sign suggest "ni" but do not necessitate it.
Among buds and branches I weep for her.

2: ku₃-zu-ŋu₁₀ '' nin ga-ša-an-gir(*HAxgunu)-gi₄-lu

My wise one, the lady Ningirgilu.

3: kur gul-gul '' mu-*gi₁₇(GIG)-ib ga-ša-an-an-na

Destroy of the lands, the mistress, Inana.

4: nin zi-ŋu₁₀ '' ga-ša-an e₂-MUŠ₃-a-ra

For my true queen, the lady of the Emush (I weep).

5: dingir unu2-ŋa₂ i-bi₂ ma-*al ama uburu2-BI-ur zi-da
  Note: the phonetic glosses in this line are written beneath the signs to which they are glosses. Note also that ubur is written DAG.KISIM₅x*GA. I've also noted that the last sign in the gloss to this sign may be "ri" instead of "ur", but that "ur" is much more likely. 

Goddess who keeps watch of the people, the lady with the true breast.

6: la-bar e₂-e ga-ša-an munus sa₆ <<blank space>
NOTE: la-bar = ES for sukkal, but also lagar, a type of cultic official.

The lagar-priestess of the temple, lady, good woman <<>>

7: UL-e pa-pa-al-ta *tuš-a-ta

After she sat among the buds and branches.

8: UL-e pa-pa-al '' an ku₃-ga-ta

Among the buds and branches of pure An.

9: UL-e pa-pa-al '' uraš-a-ta

Among the buds and branches of Urash (earth).

10: ki aŋ₂-me-e-ŋa₂-ar '' ba-an-AK-an-na   
NOTE: Cohen understands aŋ₂-me-e-ŋa₂-ar as a writing for niŋ₂-me-ŋar = "silence". 
Cohen: "Upon the place where I stay silent" - but "AK" seems to require a more transitive meaning.

That place which you made a place of silence.

11: lu₂ DI '' ama-ŋu₁₀-ra du₁₁-ga-na-ab me-na mu-un-du₈-e         
For the possibility that lu₂ DI is a writing for lu₂ du ("one who passes by") see Attinger ES n.1045. See also Kleinerman Sumerian Epistolary 158f., lu₂-di = "one who speaks", which later becomes lu₂ du = lu₂ kas₄ = "runner". This discussion is in her commentary to the line in the "monkey letter" which reads: lu₂ di lu₂ di ama-ŋu₁₀-ra u₃-na-du₁₁.

Wanderer, speak to her (Ereshkigal?) for my mother: "When will you set her free?" 

12: ga-ša-an-gir(*HAxgunu)-gi₄-lu-ke₄ du₁₁-ga-na-ab me-na mu-un-du₈-e

Speak to her for Ningirgilu: "When will you set her free?"

13: la-bar e₂-e ga-ša-an munus sa₆-ga me-na mu-un-du₈-e

"The lagar-priestess of the temple, the lady, the good woman, when will you set her free?"

14: {d}nanna-ra ŋiš-gi₄-ta du₁₁-ga-na-ab me-na mu-un-du₈-e

Speak to Nanna for her from the the canebrake: "When will you set her free?"

15: ŋiš-gi₄ daŋal an!(HAL) ku₃-ga-ta a-a-ŋu₁₀-ra du₁₁-ga-na-ab
NOTE: for ŋiš-gi daŋal see Heron and the Turtle 81: lugal-ŋu₁₀ ŋiš-gi daŋal mu-e-šum₂ nunuz ki ha-ba-ni-ib-tag: "My king, you gave (me) the wide canebreak so that I could lay eggs there".

Speak for her to my father from the wide canebreak of holy An.

16: me-na *ku₃! mu-un-tu₉(ŠE₃)tu mu-un-du₈-e me-na mu-un-du₈-e
  Note: the glosses in this line and the next are written below the sign they gloss.
NOTE: see Krecher SKL 106-7 for one instance when tu₁₀/₁₁(HUB₂) 'to heap up, strike down' = tu₉.

"When will you set free she (who) piled up silver, when will you set her free?"

17: me-na za-<<gin₃>> mu-un-tu₉(ŠE₃)tu mu-un-du₈-e me-na mu-un-du₈-e
NOTE: it is equally possible that gin₃ wasn't accidentally omitted and that "za" is either an abbreviated writing for lapis, or means simply "precious stone". See, for example, Dumuzi-Inana C 17: za tur-tur, which is parallel to za-gin₃ tur-tur in Inana's Descent.

"When will you set free she (who) piled up lapis, when will you set her free?"

18: ku₃ i₃-tuku-a ku₃-ŋu¬₁₀ ba-ti
NOTE: this translation assumes that "ti" is a phonetic writing for "te". Note, however, the variant lines at the end of the tablet, which read: "ku₃ a-a-ŋu₁₀ ba-til-la-ta // za a-a-ŋu₁₀ ba-til-la-ta", and raise the possibility that "ti" is a writing for "til" 'to be finished, used up'. Note also, that even though the grammar would be incorrect, the beginnings of these lines should probably be translated 'the silver/lapis of my father' -- see also lines 22-23 where "silver/lapis of" makes more contextual sense than "silver/lapis, my father".

"The one who has silver approached(?) my silver."

19: za-gin₃ i₃-tuku-a za-<<gin₃>>-ŋu₁₀ ba-ti

"The one who has lapis approached(?) my lapis."

20: e₂-eš₃-da-ŋu₁₀ igi-ni-še₃ ba-gul
NOTE: Cohen understands eš₃-da as a writing of eš-da 'barrel', but it is hard to imagine that e₂-eš₃-da is not just a partially phonetic writing of e₂-eš₃-dam, which is a common term used to describe shrines of Inana.

"My shrine was destroyed in her presence!"

21: <+e₂>-<+eš₃>-da-ŋu₁₀ igi-ni-še₃ ba-hul

"My shrine was annihilated in her presence!"

22: [ku₃] <*+a>-+a-ŋu₁₀ igi-ni-še₃ ba-pe-<el>

"The silver, my father, was defiled in her presence!"
OR: The silver of my father was desecrated in her presence! (see note to l.18 above)

23: [za] <*+a>-+a-gu₁₀ igi-ni-še₃ <ba>-[i-ra]

"The lapis, my father (OR: of my father), was [plundered] in her presence!"

24: [ku₃-zu-ŋu₁₀] *i-lu nu-a-še₃ ir₂ am₃-da-<*ni>-[še₈-še₈]
  Note: I've noted that it is possible that the last preserved sign in the line may not be "ni". This line almost certainly resumes l.2 of the text and refers to the lamenter lamenting for Ningirgilu.

"I am weeping on account of the wise one who is lying down in wailing."

25: [ga-ša-an]-<gir>(*HAxgunu)-gi₄-lu-ke₄ i-lu nu-a-še ir₂ am₃-<da>-[ni-še₈-še₈]

"I am weeping one account of Ningirgilu who is lying down wailing."

9: gaba-ni kušub ku₃-ga al-gul-e ir₂ gig i₃-<*še₈>-<*še₈> 
NOTE: for a similar image similar to this line and the next see Ur Lament 299-300.

She pummels her breasts (as if they were) a pure ub-drum, she laments bitterly. 

10: siki-ni u2numun-SAR-ra i₃-dub₂-e ir₂ gig i₃-<še₈>-<*še₈>

  Note: I've noted that the number of horizontal wedges inside "nin₉" is not visible on the tablet. Note also that the wedges are not visible on the tablet in "i₃" in rev. 9-10, but is nonetheless likely that the intended sign is "ni" and that "ni-me-en" is a phonetic writing of "niŋin".

  Note: I've noted that the "ta" in this line and the next is written differently (more cursively, without the crossed wedges before the final vertical) than it is in the main part of the tablet.

&&BM 23666 (CT 58, 16) = Source A
Long single column tablet; not same format as other syllabic duplicates. The right edge of the tablet is exceedingly worn, making it almost impossible to read the signs near the end of the lines.

Note: top edge of tablet seems to have "[. . .] MUŠ₃" written on it.

1: [x x x] *en-*ki *mu *KA <*ga>? *GAM am₃-<me>-<en>-ki-*en

NOTE: the readings of the last two signs in the line are based on the copy, since the surface of the tablet has become too worn to reconstruct the signs that may have been there when the copy was made. Kramer (in CT 58) reads "as₃-sa₂" and translates this phrase "I alone".

  Note: the first "DU" is written in the usual way "DU" is written, but the second is written in the idiosyncratic way, with a second horizontal wedge near the bottom wedge of the sign, which makes it look more like "da", as is found in some of the other tablets from this group.

NOTE: Alster interprets bu-uš as a phonetic writing of pad₃-de₃ based on the parallels with BM 88406 rev. 9-10 = BM 23666 rev.71-72 which has -pad₃-de₃ for -bu-us₂-se, but is very unclear, how beyond this parallel, bu-uš can be a writing for pad₃-de₃.

3: ma-niŋin₃-ŋar-ta mu-gig-<bi> <x> [. . .]
NOTE: for ma-niŋin₃-ŋar see Krecher SKL 128f., who cites CBS 11349 (STVC 30) col. ii 6: ma! niŋin₃-ŋar-ra kur-kur-ra-ŋu₁₀ = SBH 31 31: 19f: e₂ niŋin₃-mar-ra kur-kur-ra-ŋu₁₀ // E₂ ni₃-ŋa₂-ru a-ma-a-ti. The expression seems to refer to either a treasure house or a holy chamber. Although the niŋin₃-ŋar-ra is associated primarily with Ninisina, Krecher SKL 130 also lists attestations of a ma niŋin₃-ŋar-ra of Inana. One of these sources is AO 5382 (TCL 15, 16) obv. 32 - a 1st millennium source with a bilingual hymn to Ishtar, with a passage very similar to this and the following lines, in so far as each of the lines ends with "ki-in-gi-ra men₃". Inana is also referred to as the nu-gig of the niŋin₃-ŋar-ra  in TH 40: 513. See also Sjoeberg TCS 3: 92-93 for further references to this structure.

7: *me eŋ₃?-mah? me-en ki-en-gi₄-ra me-en
NOTE: one possibility I considered was reading unu₂(TE!.UNUG!) mah at the beginning of the line, but the first sign is clearly "me" and the second sign looks more like eŋ₃ than UNUG (cf. the UNUG in zabalam in the preceding line). 

..., you are, of Sumer, you are.

8: egi-re ul gur₃-ru ul <gi>-<ri> [. . .]
  AO 5382 obv. 36: [(x) x] ul men₃ ul men₃ e₃-a-ta + Akk.
CT 58: p.17 interprets this and the following lines: egi-re ul gur₃-ru ul gi-<ri>-[na-ŋu₁₀-ne] // ga-ša-an me-en za gur₃-ru za gi-[ri-na-ŋu₁₀-ne] // ku₃-sig₁₇ za-gin₃-na mul-mul-a-[ŋu₁₀-ne] translating: "When I make my gold and lapis lazuli shine like stars". If Ni 2889 (ISET 3 pp.83-84) really does parallel this source, then it is possible that the ends of these lines should read "gu₃ e₃-a-ŋu₁₀-ne" as they do in the corresponding lines of that source.

The interpretation of this form/these forms is complicated by inconsistencies in the rendering of gaba or ga-ba- as both gaba and ga-ba; cf. Ni 2889 (ISET 3 pp.83-84: rev.40f.), a partial duplicate of this text, which has ga-ba-e-me-e-re₇-eš for the corresponding form. Since *ga-ba-mu- is an impossible prefix chain for a verb, it does seem more likely that ga-ba is a phonetic writing for gaba, and not vice versa, but the meaning of this form/these forms remains obscure.

Text No. 23: Dumuzi, who will never drink again

** "Dumuzi, who will never drink again"

 ** VAT 6085 (VS 2, 34)

Top edge of tablet: [. . .] <KA>? [. . .]
Obv.
1: ŋuruš <tab>-ba [. . .]-<ga>-ŋu₁₀
NOTE: Based on the parallel between the beginning of this text and the beginning of BM 15795 (Cohen Ersh. 88), which begins with the line ŋuruš dab₅-ba e-en gig-ga-bi, an incipit which occurs in l.28 and 65 of the Ershemma catalogue BM 23771, and is followed by a litany in which lines that begin with "a ŋuruš" are followed by epithets of Damu, it is possible that the end of the line is to be restored "e-en gig-ga-ŋu₁₀". If VAT 6085 and BM 15795 are in fact parallel, then the main difference would be that Dumuzi (and his epithets) replace Damu and his epithets. It should be noted, however, that the sign read as "ga" in the next line is copied as "na", and though the photo of the tablet does allow for the possibility that the last two signs in the line are <ga-ŋu₁₀>, "na [(x)]" is more likely. Yet another possibility is to read "ga-ŋu₁₀" as "ga-mu" and understand it as a phonetic writing of "gam-mu", the form that concludes a similar Dumuzi litany in BM 87518, another Dumuzi lament. 
Young man who has been seized [. . .]


2: a ŋuruš [. . .] <+an>?-<+na>? [(x)]
  NOTE: in light of parallels with other Dumuzi litanies (in particular BM 109167 obv. 2f.), this line should probably be restored a ŋuruš [ama-ušumgal]-<an>-na. The reconstructions proposed for the following lines are also based on this parallel source.

NOTE: The sign after "AŠ" in this and the following lines could be either "DU₃" or "NI". The most likely possibilities are therefore "dili-ni" = 'she alone' or "dili-du₃" 'bound as one', both of which are attested in the lament corpus. A further difficulty is determining whether the signs before AŠ.NI are a-ba or i₇.

NOTE: the restorations in this and the following lines follow Fritz (2003): 134 n.525, except he read "a mir-mir" "wild water", instead of "a lu₃-lu₃" 'muddled water', which seems more probable in light of the frequent occurrence of a lu₃-lu₃ in connection with the netherworld.

A long section from this composition is also duplicated in BM 15793 (CT 42, 7), a Group One Landscape tablet in which the overlapping lines are identified as being from Ershemma to Gula.

Following source A:

Obv.

  A (VAT 1367): *u₃-*u₈ *ga-*am₃-du₁₁ '' <*u₃> [. . .]

  C (Obv. 1'): [. . .] <du₁₁>? (no longer visible on tablet)

Woe! I want to say. Woe! I want to say.

2: u₃-u₈ ga-am₃-du₁₁ gibil-la₂ ga-am₃-du₁₁
  A: *u₃-*u₈ ga-am₃-du₁₁ '' <*gibil> [. . .] 
  Note: the "u₈" in this line looks a little different than it does in the previous line.
  B 2: [. . .] <*am₃>-<*du₁₁> [. . .] *gibil-*la₂ ga-am₃-du₁₁
  E 2: <*u₃> *ga-*am-*du *[(x)] <<b.s.>>
  C (Obv. 2'): [. . .] <du₁₁>? (no longer visible on tablet)

Woe! I want to say. I want to say again and again!

3: na-aŋ₂ e₂-ŋu₁₀-še₃ u₃-u₈ ga-am₃-du₁₁
  A: na-aŋ₂ *e₂-*ŋu₁₀-*še₃ '' *u₃ [. . .]
  B 3: <*na>-*aŋ₂ *e₂-*ŋu₁₀-*še₃ [. . .] <*am₃>?-*du₁₁
NOTE: there seems to be the beginning of a sign after še₃ before the break in the middle of the line that does not look like the beginning of u₃ and that may belong to <na>. This sign wasn't copied, but it is visible in the photo.
  E 3: <*na>-*MI-*ŋu₁₀-*še₃!(TUG₂) <<b.s.>>
  Note: "na" seems likely both on the basis of the size of the break and the few preserved traces of the sign, but it is not possible to determine this with certainty.
Krecher interprets na-mi- as na-me₂- -- a sandhi writing of na-aŋ₂ e₂-, which seems likely
  C (Obv. 3'): [. . .] <du₁₁>? (no longer visible on tablet)
at least three lines defaced in source C

On account of my house I want to say woe!

  Note: the last three signs and most of "u₈" are no longer preserved on the tablet, so they must have been reconstructed.

  E 4: *na-*aŋ₂ *uru₂-*ŋu₁₀-<*še₃> <<b.s.>>

  Note the traces of the sign after "ši" are not really visible at all.
  B 5: <*lu₂> *eŋ₃-*ŋu₁₀-*a *i-*bi₂ *ba-*ra me-en [(x) (x)]
  E 5: <*lu₂>? *a-*ŋu¬₁₀-<*a> <<b.s.>>
  Note: "lu" is possible on the basis of the preserved traces, but since the sign is largely broken the traces, and especially the width of the sign, seem equally to support "lu₂". Note also when the traces of this sign are compared with "lu" in l.33, on the bottom edge of the tablet, "lu₂" begins to seem even more certain.
Krecher see the writing a-ŋu₁₀ for eŋ₃-ŋu₁₀ as evidence that eŋ₃ 'thing', is to be read aŋ₂ and not eŋ₃.

One who looks after my things, I am.

6: nam-tar-ŋu₁₀-a ba-e-gub-ba me-en
  A: *nam-*tar-*ŋu₁₀-*a '' <*u₄>? [. . .]
  Note: there are no longer any traces of the sign read as "u₄".
  B 6: <*nam>-*tar-*u-*a *ba-*e-*gub-*ba *me [. . .]
NOTE: Krecher reads ud-e instead of ba-e, but ba is completely certain.
  E 6: *nam-*ta-<*ru>-*a <<b.s.>>
  Note: "ru" is nearly certain, and the sign is definitely not "ra" or "re".

One who stands by my fate, I am.

7: nam-tar gig gub-gub-ba me-en u₃-<<u₈ ga-am₃-du₁₁>>
  A: nam-*tar *+gi-*+gub-*+gub-<ba>? [. . .]
  Note: there are almost no traces of the sign read as "ba".
  B 7: <*nam>-*tar-*ra *gi-*e gub?-gub?-*ba me-en <*u₃> [. . .]
NOTE: it is not completely certain that the two signs between "e" and "ba" are gub-gub, but if they are gi-e-gub may be a sandhi writing for gig gub-gub-ba. Krecher's scepticism about "ŠI" at the end of the line not belonging to "u₃" is ungrounded, since the tablet breaks off right after ŠI making it possible (though of course not certain) that the end of u₃ followed.
  E 7: <*nam>-<*ta>? <x> <x> <<b.s.>>
  C (Obv. 7'): [. . .] <x> <gi>? <x> [. . .]
NOTE: it is possible that one of the two broken sign in C is "gi" or "tuku", but this is far from certain.

One who establishes a terrible fate, I am - I want to say woe!

8: dam an-tuku-a dam-ŋu₁₀ nu-me-en <<u₃-u₈ ga-am₃-du₁₁>>
  A: *dam *an-*tuku-<*tuku> [. . .]
  B 8: <da>?-ma-an-*du-*ka dam-ŋu₁₀ nu-me-en <x> [. . .]
Krecher reads the beginning of this source: dam-ma-an-du-du₁₁, but du-ka for tuku-a seems just as probable.
  E 8: <*dam> *[x]-*DU.*DU <<b.s.>>
  The break between "dam" and "DU" is large enough, but not much larger, than "an", and may have contained [A.AN].
  C (Obv. l.8'): [. . .] <x> i-bi₂ <x> [. . .]

One who has a spouse - you are not my spouse - I want to say woe!

  E 9: *dumu <*a>? [x (x)] DU <<b.s.>>
  Note: here the break is large enough for two signs, and if the traces of the first broken sign are from "a", which seems likely, then it is probable that "[<A>.AN.U₃?].DU" was in the break. 
  C (Obv. 9'): [. . .] <tu>?-*tu *dumu-*ŋu₁₀ [. . .]

  E 12: <*u₈>? <<b.s.>>
  Note: "u₈" seems unlikely on the basis of the preserved sources, unless it is a very poorly written "u₈".
Krecher plausibly reconstructs the verbal form (in source C) as mi₂--du₁₁ and suggests translating, "like a ewe tending to a foreign lamb", though it is not clear what the significance of this image would be, and the image of ewes and goats being separated from their lambs and kids is much more common in the laments.

NOTE: the scribe definitely wrote "bi" (with two horizontal wedges) followed by "ga" (with three horizontal wedges), suggesting that ga-bi was probably intended. Since the end of the following "KA" sign is broken, it is also possible, if not likely, that there was an "A" inscribed in the sign.

18: e₂-e e₂-bi e₂ nam-tar-re-da a-gin₇ mi-in-da-an-ku₄-[re-en]
NOTE: it is probable (as Krecher argues) that a-gin₇-mi-in-da-an-ku₄ [. . .] is a sandhi writing for im-da-an-. Note also that he reads the end of the verb -ku₄-re-en
  A: <*e₂>-*e *e₂-*bi <*+e₂> [. . .] 
NOTE: there is blank space following this line and preceding the next one, and since there is a dividing line at this point in the text in source E, it is probable that this line indicates the end of a section.

  From the alignment of the broken fragments containing the end of the lines on the bottom edge fragment, it is uncertain whether the traces of the signs read as "ŋal₂-e/lu" belong to the end of the first part of the line or the second; but give the parallels with source B the second half of the liine seems more likely.

  A: [x] <*ba>?-*ŋu₁₀ <x> [. . .]
  Note: "ba" is reasonably certain and there seem to be traces of the end of another sign which must have been small, judging from the size of the break. As Krecher notes, it is unlikely that the traces of the preceding sign belong to "igi". 
  B 22: [x]-ŋu₁₀ al-tar-tar-re al-ma-ma ŋa₂ mu-na-KU-e-en
  E 26: <*igi>-*bi <*al>? [(x) (x) (x) (x)] <<b.s.>>

BM 15793 col. ii 2: i-bi₂-ŋu₁₀ al-tar-re al-ma [. . .]
NOTE: since in nearly every occurrence of al-tar = 'work' the verb is "gub", this and the writing al-tar-tar in source B make it unlikely that "work" is meant here, but what else could have been intended here is equally uncertain. 

Before me work(?) is being done - I sit here(?) for him.

5 (27): bar-ŋu₁₀ al-tar-re al-ma-ma ŋa₂-e mu-na-KU-e-en
  A: <*bar!>-*ŋu₁₀ <*al>? [. . .]  
  Note: the sign at the beginning of the line looks a bit like "qa", or "bar" with a winkelhaken at the bottom of the sign. In light of the "bar" in source E, it therefore seems probable that this sign is "bar" written over another sign.
  B 23: [x (x)]-ŋu₁₀ al-tar-tar-re al-ma-ma ŋa₂ mu-na-KU-e-en
  E 27: <*bar>*ar-*ŋu₁₀ <<b.s.>>

NOTE: Krecher rules out NE after bi₂-, but the photo has a very clear "NE" here. The sign after it is less certain, but "e" is possible. It is unlikely that there were any additional signs in the small break after "e" though, making it likely that the traces of the signs in the space below this line on the bottom edge belong to the end of this line.

BM 15793 col. ii 9: ki pel₂-la-bi ki ur₅-ra-bi ur₂-<ŋa₂> [. . .] <ŋa₂>

NOTE: Krecher reads pel₂ as gibil, and noting another instance when gibil and ur₅ occur in parallelism (SKL 113f.), he argues that these phrases are to be translated "immer Neue" and "immer Gleiche". The phonetic writing "bi-la" for "NExPAP" in source E, rules out "gibil" completely, though, and requires that the sign be read "pel₂". Also, in the parallel cited by Krecher there is not a "ki" before NExPAP and ur₅, and there the verb is also "e" 'to speak'.

At that defiled place, at that place of debt, (the fate determined there) was placed in my lap.

Note: there is a small break at the beginning of the tablet here, but since the average width of the lines in this part of the tablet is ca.5-6mm, and the break between the traces of the signs preserved in the previous line and the next preserved signs is approximately the same width it seems likely that only one line is completely broken here.

BM 15793 col. ii 33: *su?-<*bar>?-*ŋa₂ *bar-*ŋa₂ *mu-*ub-*be₂ *šu-*še₃ <<blank space>>
  NOTE: "su-bar" at the beginning of the line is very uncertain, though it is possible that the tablet has su?-bar <<ersasure of one sign>>-ŋa₂. Given the structure of the preceding line, however, what would be expected here is NOUN (body part) bar-ŋa₂ bar-ŋa₂ etc. For this reason, su-bar 'body' makes very little sense, especially in light of the bar-ŋa₂ which follows. Since there is space in the erased part of the tablet after the first sign for "bar", the question becomes what the sign at the beginning of the line (which is perfectly preserved on the tablet) might be.

NOTE: "zu" is not completely certain, but the bottom wedge seems to slant in way that suggests that it is more likely that this sign is "zu" than "ke₄". It is also possible that "ma" is to be read "a₂!". The broken sign before "da" is likely to be either "mu" or "im", but the traces are not decisive.
BM 15793 col. ii 35: *mu-*lu₂-<*zu>? *a₂-*ŋu₁₀ mu-da-ab-ha-lam-<ma>? [. . .]

Note also that the last sign at the end of this line and the next is too box-like to be "ba", but does not seem to have a vertical wedge in the middle of it, the way the corresponding sign does in the next line, suggesting that this sign is "KU" and the sign in the next line is "LU" and has a clear vertical wedge inside the top horizontal wedge of the sign making it nearly certain that it is "LU".

Obv.
beginning of obverse broken
1': <ama>-ni₅(NE) <lu>-<li> [. . .]

S: lu-li-[ŋu₁₀] (for ???) and w.u. -ni₅ (for -ni)
N.S.: ama
T: 1 + 1 w.u. S, 1 N.S.; 2 + 1 w.u.

2': ama-ni₅ lu-li-<ŋu₁₀> [. . .]

S: lu-li-ŋu¬₁₀ (for ???) and w.u. -ni₅ (for -ni)
N.S.: ama
T: 1 + 1 w.u. S, 1 N.S.; 2 + 1 w.u.

3': ama-ni₅ lu-li-<ŋu₁₀> [. . .]

S: lu-li-ŋu¬₁₀ (for ???) and w.u. -ni₅ (for -ni)
N.S.: ama
T: 1 + 1 w.u. S, 1 N.S.; 2 + 1 w.u.

4': ama-ni₅ lu-li-ŋu₁₀ <*ŋa₂> <AB>? [. . .]
  Note: it is possible that the sign read as "ŋa₂" is "e₂", but "ŋa₂" is more likely.

S: lu-li-ŋu¬₁₀ (for ???) and w.u. -ni₅ (for -ni)
N.S.: ama
T: 1 + 1 w.u. S, 1 N.S.; 2 + 1 w.u.
Uncertain: e₂ or ŋa₂ and AB

5': ama-ni₅ lu-li-ŋu₁₀ u₃-mu-un <x> [. . .]

S: lu-li-ŋu¬₁₀ (for ???) and w.u. -ni₅ (for -ni)
N.S.: ama and u₃-mu-un
T: 1 + 1 w.u. S, 2 N.S.; 3 + 1 w.u.

6': ama-ni₅ lu-li-ŋu₁₀ mu-lu tu-ra-na (tur₃-na) nu-mu-un-na-mu

S: lu-li-ŋu¬₁₀ (for ???), tu-ra (for tur₃), and na-mu (for ???) and w.u. -ni₅ (for -ni)
N.S.: ama, mu-lu, and w.u. -na, nu-, -mu-, and -un-
T: 3 + 1 w.u. S, 2 + 4 w.u. N.S.; 5 + 5 w.u.
Uncertain: the most common verb that occurs with tur₃ and amaš in laments in -gul or any other verb of destruction, but the negation of the verb and the probability that mu-lu is the agent may point to a verb like AK or ŋa₂-ŋa₂.

Fritz 2003: 129 n.496 translates: "Seine Mutter hat ihren kranken Mann mit keinem 'Oh weh mir!' bekleidet", interpreting lu-li-ŋu₁₀ as being from a-li-lu instead of as lu-lim 'deer', like Krecher ZA 57 (1965): 18f.

7': ama-ni₅ lu-li-ŋu₁₀ mu-lu a-ma-sa₂-na (amaš-na) nu-mu-un-na-mu

S: lu-li-ŋu¬₁₀ (for ???), a-ma-sa₂ (for amaš), and na-mu (for ???) and w.u. -ni₅ (for -ni)
N.S.: ama, mu-lu, and w.u. -na, nu-, -mu-, and -un-
T: 3 + 1 w.u. S, 2 + 4 w.u. N.S.; 5 + 5 w.u.

8': ir im-ma-pad₃ *si!-*si i-ma-ma
  Note that the first "si" does not seem to have any wedges inside the box that makes up the rest of the sign, though the vertical wedge does appear in the second "si".

S: si-si (for isiš), ir (for ir₂), and w.u. i- (for i₃-)
N.S.: pad₃, -ma, -ma, and w.u. im- and -ma-
T: 2 + 1 w.u. S, 3 + 2 w.u.; 5 + 3 w.u.

9': ir da-ar-da-ra-bi i-bi-ni mu-un-di-ge

S: ir, da-ar, da-ra, i-bi (for i-bi¬₂), and di-ge (for ???)
N.S.: w.u. -bi, -ni, mu-, and -un- 
T: 5 S, 4 w.u. N.S.; 5 + 4 w.u.

10': ir mu-da i-re ba-an-ga ir ši-ši nu-DI

S: ir, i-re (for ir₂-re), ir, ši-ši (šex-šex), mu-da (for ???)
N.S.: -ga, -di and w.u. ba-, -an-, and nu-
T: 6 S, 2 + 3 w.u. N.S.; 8 + 3 w.u.

11': ir tu-ra i-re ba-ŋa₂-ŋa₂ ši-ša nu-*uš₂(BAD)?-gu-le (gul-e)
  Note: the sign read as "uš₂" could be either another "nu" or "BAD" - since the sign is tightly squeezed on the tablet, it is difficult to determine which sign was intended with certainty.

S: ir, tu-ra (for tur-ra?), i-re, ši-ša (for isiš), gu-le (for gul-le), and w.u. nu-uš₂ (for nu-uš)
N.S. -ŋa₂, -ŋa₂ and w.u. ba-
T: 5 + 1 w.u. S, 2 + 1 w.u. N.S.; 7 + 2 w.u.

Fritz 2003: 129 n.498 translates er-tu-re i-re ba-ŋa₂-ŋa₂ as "Die Klagende setze eine trauende Klage"

12': uru₂ i-ra nu-*DU! i-re ba-ni-ma-al
  Note: there seems to be a stray wedge with "DU" which may either be a mistake, or it may indicate šeššig-marking with "DU".

S: i-ra (for ir₂-ra), i-re
N.S.: uru₂, DU, ma-al and w.u. nu-, ba-, and -ni-
T: 2 S, 3 + 3 w.u. N.S.; 5 + 3 w.u.

Fritz 2003: 129 n.498 translates: "(In der) Stadt, die Klage nie geäussert(?) hatte, hat die Klagende sie vorhanden sein lassen". 

13': a-ši-ra nu-DU a-ši-ir ba-ni-ma-al

S: a-ši-ir (for a-še-er) and a-ši-ra (for a-še-er-ra)
N.S. ma-al, DU and w.u. nu-, ba-, and -ni-
T: 2 S, 2 + 3 w.u. N.S.; 4 + 3 w.u.

Fritz 2003: 129 n.499 translates: "(Wer bislang) nicht getrauert hatte, liess dort Klage vorhanden sein".

14': ir nu-zu-a ir i-ši-ši-e

S: ir, ir, ši, ši-e (for šex) and w.u. i (for i₃)
N.S.: zu and w.u. nu- and -a
T: 4 + 1 w.u. S, 1 + 2 w.u. N.S.; 5 + 3 w.u.
Note: this and the following lines occur almost verbatim in normal ES orthography in MAH 16014 rev. 3f. (an Ershemma of Dumuzi with the lamenting reed) = 
  3: ir₂ nu-zu-a ir₂ i₃-še₈-še₈
  4: a-še-er nu-zu-a a-še-er i₃-ŋa₂-ŋa₂-an
  5: a-še-er ir₂-re ir₂ im-ma-ni-in-pad₃
  6: a-še-er tur₃-bi ba-ŋin-na-ba ir₂ im-ma-ni-in-pad₃
  7: amaš ku₃ amaš-a ba-ul₄-la-ba ul₄-la-ba ir₂ im-ma-ni-in-pad₃
  8: a e₂-ŋu₁₀ im-me a uru₂-ŋu₁₀ im-me
  9: a ur₅-ŋu₁₀ im-me a ša₃-ŋu₁₀ im-me
  10: a bar-ŋu₁₀ im-me a ra-ma-ni im-me

15': a-ši-ir nu-zu-a a-ši-ir i-ma-ma

S: a-ši-ir, a-ši-ir, and w.u. i-
N.S.: zu, -ma, and -ma and w.u. nu- and -a
T: 2 + 1 w.u. S, 3 + 2 w.u. N.S.; 5 + 3 w.u.

Following Fritz 2003: 129 n.500, this and the preceding line can be translated: "He who doesn't know lamenting, laments bitterly // He who doesn't know wailing, wails bitterly".

16': mi *ba-da-gu-bi (gub-be₂) mu-lu gu-ba(-)bi-ne-*ni(OR: ir)
  Note: the sign read as "ma" looks more like "ba" or possibly "KU". Note also that there appear to be only two wedges in the last sign in the line, making it possible that "ni" and not "ir" was intended.
S: mi (for ???), gu-be₂ (for gub-be₂), gu-ba (for gub-ba)
N.S.: mu-lu and w.u. ba- and -da-
T: 3 S, 1 + 2 w.u. N.S.; 4 + 2 w.u.
Uncertain: the significance of (-)bi-NE-ni(OR: ir) at the end of the line
Fritz 2003: 130 n.501 interprets this and the following lines to stand for: "ŋi₆-a ba-da-gub-ba-e mu-lu gub-ba bi₂-be₂-ne // ŋi₆-a ba-da-tuš-a-e mu-lu gub-ba bi₂-be₂-ne", which can be translated: "Those who stand by him in the night, say: 'Man, remain standing!', and those who sit by him in the night say: 'Remain standing, man!'.

17': mi ba-da-tu-ši mu-lu gu-ba(-)bi-NE-en

S: mi, tu-še (for tuš-e), and gu-ba
N.S.: mu-lu and w.u. ba- and -da-
T: 3 S, 1 + 2 w.u. N.S.; 4 + 2 w.u.
Uncertain: the significance of (-)bi-NE-en at the end of the line

18': *ba-da-gu-ba mu ba-da-gu-bi

S: gu-ba, gu-be₂, and mu (shortened form of mu-lu?)
N.S.: w.u. ba-, ba-, -da-, and -da-
T: 3 S, 4 w.u. N.S.; 3 + 4 w.u.

End of obverse

1: ba-da-tu-uš mu ba-da-tu-uš 

S: tu-uš, tu-uš, and mu
N.S.: w.u. ba-, ba-, -da-, and -da-
T: 3 S, 4 w.u. N.S.; 3 + 4 w.u.

2: u₃ ga-gi-en di ha-ar-nu-ta ga-gi-en / <<ma-da>> ma-da-an-DU

S: u₃ (for ???), gi-en (for ŋin?), gi-en, ha-ar-nu (for har-ra-an-nu?)
N.S. DU and w.u. ga-, ga-, -ta, ma- and -da-
T: 4 S, 1 + 5 w.u.; 5 + 5 w.u.
Uncertain: significance of DI

S: lu-li-ŋu₁₀, lu-li-ŋu₁₀
N.S. a, a
T: 2 S, 2 N.S.; 4
NOTE: for these lines and their parallels in PRAK C 118 rev. ii 17-19 and HS 1494 (TUM 3, 26), see Krecher ZA 57 (1965): 18f. In contrast to Civil in JNES 28 and Fritz 2003, Krecher interprets lu-li as a phonetic writing of lu-lim "deer", instead of as another word for "woe".

4: a lu-li-ŋu₁₀ u₃-mu-un KA-nu-na

S: lu-li-ŋu₁₀, gu₃-nu-na (for unug{ki}-ga?)
N.S.: a and u₃-mu-un
T: 2 S, 2 N.S.; 4

5: a lu-li-ŋu₁₀ u₃-mu-un e-mu-ša (e₂-MUŠ₃?)

S: lu-li-ŋu₁₀, e (for e₂), and mu-ša (for MUŠ₃-a)
N.S.: a and u₃-mu-un
T: 3 S, 2 N.S.; 5

6: a lu-li-im lu-li-im ama-ni₅ ama-ni₅

S: lu-li-im, lu-li-im and w.u. -ni₅ and -ni₅
N.S.: a, ama, and ama
T: 2 + 2 w.u. S, 3 N.S.; 5 + 2 w.u.

7: ama-ni₅ ama i-re al-ku-*šu-a-ri

S: i-re (for ir₂-re), ku-šu (for kuš₂-u₃) and w.u. -ni₅
N.S.: ama, ama and w.u. al-
T: 2 + 1 w.u. S, 2 + 1 w.u. N.S.; 4 + 2 w.u.
Uncertain: meaning of -a-ri

With Krecher this and the following lines can be translated as:
"His mother, that mother who is worn out by lamenting // etc." 

8: i-re a-ši-re al-ku-šu-a-ri

S: i-re (for ir₂-re), ku-šu, and a-ši-re (for a-še-er-re) 
N.S.: w.u. al-
T: 3 S, 1 w.u. N.S.; 3 + 1 w.u.
Uncertain: meaning of -a-ri

9: a-ši-ir ir₂-re al-ku-šu-a-ri

S: a-ši-ir (for a-še-er), ku-šu
N.S.: ir₂-re and w.u. al-
T: 2 S; 1 + 1 w.u. N.S.; 3 + 1 w.u.
Uncertain: meaning of -a-ri

10: ama-ni₅ nu-di-de₃ *bi-in-du-ga-ŋu₁₀

S: du-ga (for du₁₁-ga) and w.u. -ni₅ and bi-
N.S.: ama and w.u. nu-, -in-, and -ŋu₁₀
T: 1 + 2 w.u. S, 1 + 3 w.u. N.S.; 2 + 5 w.u.
Uncertain: meaning of di-de₃(NE)

11: <ama>? da di ga-na-*aŋ₂ ba-an-ši-ta-ba-na

S: ga-na-aŋ₂ (for kalag?), ta-ba (for dab₅-ba?)
N.S.: w.u. ba-, -an-, -ši-, and -na
T: 2 S, 4 w.u. N.S.; 2 + 4 w.u.
Uncertain: everything else
Fritz 2003: 130 n.503 considers the possibility that ta-ba is for tab-ba and translates the verb at the end of the line as "indem niemand ihn begleitet".


12: [. . .] da-ka-la <na>-*ma ba-an-ši-ta-ba-na

S: da-ka-la (for daŋal?), na-ma (for ???), ta-ba
N.S.: w.u. ba-, -an-, -ši-, and -na
T: 3 S, 4 w.u. N.S.; 3 + 4 w.u.

13: [. . .] <*x> <*a> *e <*bi>? [. . .] ka-la ba-an-ši / [. . .] <x> NE DI

Text No. 30: Phonetic Inana Lament

&&BM 78983 (cited by Michalowski in OA 19, 267) = OB literary, photo BM website. Multi-column tablet, has an entire section which duplicates a section of VAT 604+ (VS 2, 3), a source which has sections that duplicate PRAK C 124 (AO 10740 - See Cavigneaux ASJ 9, p.58 for a new copy). In addition, the first section of both this source and VAT 604+ begin with a section that contains a passage with pairs of lines that end with gi-NE.DI.TU and hu-mu-ra-u₃-tu. Syllabic. col. i = 6.8cm in width - multiply by two to obtain approximate width of tablet.

Note also, however, that in the writing of Nanna as "ŠEŠ.KI", the "ki" sign seems to have only two horizontals, so it is possible that "ki" was sometime also written cursively.

Note also that the head of the last sign in the line appears to be uninscribed, making it possible that this is "bi" instead of "ga" (note, however, at the end of the next line the sign is clearly "ga").

VAT 1370 (top right corner of a tablet assumed to belong to same tablet as VAT 604, with which it does not physically join). The ductus indicates that it definitely belongs to one of the multi-column tablets in the ka-ša-an group, but it will be left open whether it belongs to VAT 604+.

  Note: the inside of the top of the sign read as "še₃" is broken making it impossible to determine whether there were more than the two preserved horizontal wedges inside the sign, but it seems likely that there were, and the box around the sign seems too narrow to be "tug₂". Note also that the horizontal with the last sign is at the same height with respect to the preceding vertical as with "me" in the preceding line and even lower than with "me" at the end of l.9.

Text No. 31: Dumuzi's Sisters
NOTE: ETCSL translates this text as "Dumuzi and his Sisters"

&&BM 79510 (CT 58: 3) = "Dumuzi's Sisters"

Obv.
col. ii
beginning of obverse col. ii broken
1': [. . .] <x> ŋar(-)MU
NOTE: The presence of "MU" at the ends of this and the following lines is difficult to interpret, especially since the possessive suffix "-ŋu¬₁₀" typically does not follow "bi", as it seems to do in the following two lines. If this is not the possessive suffix "-ŋu₁₀" though, another possibility would be to interpret "mu" as the beginning of a verbal form of which only the first sign in the verbal chain is written because the verb is repeated in the preceding lines. Since this sign seems to occur at the end of the line, without any blank space to indicate that the rest of the form has been omitted, however, this also seems unlikely, and the presence of "sig₃-a-ŋu₁₀" in l.4 and the occurrence of lines that end with me-en after the lines ending with "MU" would be additional indications that the first person possessive suffix was intended here.

5': [. . .] <x> [. . .] saŋ <šum₂>-<šum₂>(-)MU
NOTE: another possibility is to read the verb at the end of the line as saŋ--si₃ = 'to entrust'

When I advance against ...

6': [. . .] <ma>-al-la '' zu [. . .] <MU>
NOTE: "zu" is written apart from "ma-al-la" at the beginning of the second half of the line, making it possible that "zu" is not a possessive suffix, but a noun (possibly su!), or the beginning of another form. Since nouns that begin with "zu" are uncommon though, it is possible that this "-zu" does in fact go with ma-al-la-zu.

When you(?) place ... my(?) ...

7': [. . .] ma?-ba-al-la '' <zu>? [. . .]
NOTE: it is not impossible that the broken sign before the break is "zu", especially if the "zu" in the previous line is a possessive suffix, but very little of the sign is preserved, and any number of other signs are equally possible.  

When you(?) dig(?) ...

8': [. . .] <x> šim-ŋu₁₀ '' <x> [. . .]

... my scented ...

9': [. . .] <x>? <ŋiš>?mar gu₂-un-na-MU [. . .]
NOTE: the traces of the sign or signs before "mar" could belong to "TU" or "x ŋiš" -- if the latter, then it would be necessary to read "<x> ŋišmar gu₂-un-na-MU". Another possibility, though would be to understand mar gu₂ as an imperative form of the verb "gu₂--ŋar" = 'to submit'. The presence of the possessive suffix "ŋu₁₀" in the middle of the preceding and following line, however, might indicate that "mu" is also a possessive suffix here and not part of a verbal form (also, gu₂-un-na- would be problematic for an imperative form of gu₂--ŋar.

In CT 58 (p.9) the editors read: [lu₂] a₂-la₂-a-ni i-bi₂-še₃ mu-un-da-an-du and translate: "He who bound his arm went in front of him".

The one who tied his arms walked in front with him.

33': [lu₂ šu] <du₃>-a-ni egir-ra i₃-im-DU

The one who bound his [hands] went behind him.

The ones who beat him passed through by himself.

7': [. . .] <ra> gal₅(TE)-la₂ gaba ba-an-ri
CT 58 restores: [. . . lu₂ niŋ₂] ra

The [large gala-demon], a gala-demon who beat him approached him/her.


8': [. . .] <niŋ₂>? ra gal₅-la₂ gaba ba-an-ri
NOTE: it is possible that the beginnings of this and the preceding lines are to be restored: gal₅-la₂ gu-la niŋ₂ ra // gal₅-la₂ tur niŋ₂ ra - the large (and small) galla demons who beat him.

The [small gala-demon], a gala-demon who beat him approached him/her

9': [. . .] <ri> gal₅-la₂ gaba ba-an-ri

... the gala demon who ... approached him/her.

10': [. . .] <x> <ni> an-ta ma-an-di-ni-ib₂-gi gal₅-la₂ gaba ba-an-ri
The first verb in the line is clearly an-ta-- gi₄ = maharu = to reach

His ... reached with him ... approached him/her.

11': [. . .] <x> <x>-na ki-še-er ba-an-na-ni-in-du₁₁
NOTE: ki-še-er = kuširu = 'limit'. These lines are the only occurrences of this word with du₁₁ (see Attinger, ELS, who suggests translating this phrase 'to handle/treat carefully'. CT 58 translates this verb: "he spoke out of shame to her". No matter what the precise nuance, however, the sense seems to be that the demon is showing compassion to Dumuzi's sister in this passage.

When she ... he treats her with care(?)

12': [sa sur]-ra-na siki ze₂-na ki-še-er ba-an-na-ni-in-du₁₁

When she rends her sinews, tears up her hair, he treats her with care(?)

13': [. . .] ur₅-ra-na kiri₄ ur₅-ra-na ki-še-er ba-an-na-ni-in-du₁₁

16': [. . .] <x> ki-sikil mu-lu en-ra si₃-ga za-e nin₉-ni men₃

... young woman, one who stands up for her lord, are you his sister?

17': [. . .] mu-tin {d}du₅-mu-zi-ra si₃-ga za-e nin₉-ni men₃

... spouse who stands up for Dumuzi, are you his sister?

18': [. . .] <x> nin₉ ban₃-da ŋuruš-a men₃ za-e nin₉-ni men₃

Are you the younger sister of the young man, are you his sister?

19': [. . .] <nin₉> ban₃-da {d}du₅-mu-zi-da men₃ za-e nin₉-ni men₃

I want to offer bronze for him - I am indeed his sister! 

26': gu gun₃?-na šu-ŋa₂ de₃-im-ma-al šu-ŋu₁₀ ba-ra-gig-ga-am₃
NOTE: in support of reading gun₃ here, see Dumuzi and Enkimdu l.24 where multi-colored flax seems to be something the farmer grows for Inana. CT 58 and Fritz interpret "gig" in this and the following line as "to hurt", but this translation ignores the modality of de₃¬- and ba-ra-.

I want to place colored flax in my hand, so that my hand will not be (ritually) polluted.

27': dug kurun₂-na gu₂-ŋa₂ de₃-im-ma-al gu₂-ŋu₁₀ ba-ra-gig-ga-am₃

I want to place a jug of wine on my neck, so that my neck will not be (ritually) polluted.

28': a₂ gub₃?-a-na mu-un-na-ni-tag-ge₄ a mu-da-lu-lu
ETCSL reads the verb "mu-un-na-ni-in-gi₄", which, if correct, would mean that the line should be translated: "she returned her arm to her left side"

She grasped her left(?) side for him - she roiled the water with it.

29': a ki-in-dar-re mu-na-an-de₂ mu-tin-an-na-ke₄

She poured water in the crevice for him - Geshtinanna.

NOTE: the gi ub-zal is discussed by Civil in Iraq 23 (1961): 170, where it occurs in lines 71-72 of Home of the Fish, where he translates it "reed of the inside(?)" and notes that it also occurs in Heron and the Turtle l.14, where it is described as "vying with the city" (uru-bi-da nam-da-sa₂) and as a "sweet man" (ŋuruš du₁₀-ga-am₃). See also Peterson diss. 335f. for a more detailed discussion. According to Summer and Winter 207, this reed is also consumed by sheep, and must have been an important part of their nourishment.

... consume the ub-zal reed for me.

11': [. . .] <x> šid gi ub-zal ma-<ku₂>-e
  B (Obv. l.1'): [. . .] <*mu> [. . .]
NOTE: it is uncertain whether lines 1'-5' correspond to 11'-15', or whether they differ. Beginning in l.16', however, the correspondence in the lines in the two sources appears to be more direct.

  B (Obv. l.8'): [. . .] *uru₂-*a *e-{d}utu *{d}!(ŠU₂)*utu *he-me-en *gu-<*li> [. . .]
NOTE: the traces of the first sign in this line and the next are consistent with "uru₂", though "e₂" and "ŋuruš" are less likely possibilities.

In the city, "oh Utu!" - since you are Utu, my friend

19': <*uru₂>?-*a i-{d}nanna {d}nanna he₂-me-en du₁₀-us₂-sa-ŋu₁₀

20': u₈ muš-a-ka-ŋa₂ <+muš> e₃-*ma-ra-ab he₂-me-en ku-li-ŋu₁₀
NOTE: it is possible that the sign read as "ma" as "ba", but since the bottom wedge of this sign, and of the corresponding sign in the following lines seems to be more horizontal than diagonal than the bottom wedge of "ba" in the verbal forms at the beginning of the reverse, it seems more likely that the sign here (and in the following lines is "ma", in spite of the "ba" in the phonetically written duplicate. Note also that the reading "ma" is more or less assured by the corresponding sign in source B in this line and the next, which is almost certainly "ma" and not "ba".
  B (Obv. l.10'): *um-*mu-*ša-*ŋa₂ *mu-*ud *he-*+ma-*ra [. . .]

Make the snake go away from my ewe (attacked) by a snake - since you are my friend.

21': ud₅ ga-na-<*ka>-<*ŋa₂> <ga>-<an> <e₃>-*ma-ra-ab he₂-me-en du₁₀-us₂-sa-ŋu₁₀
  B (Obv. l.11'): [. . .] <x>-<*gin₃>-*na *mu-*ud *he-*ma-*ra-*e he-me-en <*lu₂>? [. . .]
NOTE: it is possible that ga-na = Akk. ga-ra-bu = "scab"/ skin affliction - a word that is typically written with the "GAN" or "GUM₂" signs. 

Make the gan go away from my goat (afflicted) by a gan - since you are my companion.

22': ŋišRU-ŋu₁₀-<*ur> <*dugud> <ba>-<ma>-ra-ab an-na hu-mu-un-ni₁₀-ni₁₀
NOTE: the sign read as "ur" looks more like "ur" than "ta". It is also equally likely that in this line and the next the sign read as "ma" is "ba", though it has been copied and read as "ma" in CT 58.
  B (Obv. l.12'): [. . .] *el-*la-ŋu₁₀ *du-*gu-*ud *+he-<*DU/ŠA/TA>-<x> [. . .]

23': ur-ŋu₁₀ *sa-*ad!-*nim zi-ma-ra-ab *amaš-a hu-mu-un-us₂-e
NOTE: The sign between "sa" and "nim", which are completely certain, must be a poorly written "ad", since the corresponding lexeme on the reverse has a clear "ad".
  B (Obv. l.13'): [. . .] <x> *mu-*ud-*na *di-*NE <*lu₂> [. . .]

Raise off the sadnim-disease from my dog so that it slinks about in the steppe.

6: *ŋiš*RU-*a-*ni *dugud *im-*ta-*an-*ba an-na mu-un-ni₁₀-ni₁₀

The miqtu-disease was driven off with his throwstick and circles about in heaven.

7: ur-ra-ni *sa-*ad-*nim im-ta-an-ga *amaš-a mu-un-us₂-e
NOTE: the sign read as "amaš" is definitely "amaš" and not "edin".

The sadnim-disease was carried away from his dog and slinks along in the steppe. 

8: e-ne-ra kur-ŋar-ra *lul-*la-*ra šu dingir mu-na-an-du₃

For him he imposed the hand of god on the deceitful kurgaru-official.

9: amaš ku₃-ga i₃ saŋ gara saŋ-ŋa₂ mu-ni im-mi-in-pad₃

In the pure sheepfold he called his name with the finest oil and the finest cream.

10: <*u₈> <sila₄>? 2-am₃ mu-na-u₃-<tu> [. . .] 2-a-bi kir₁₁(MUNUS.SILA₄)-am₃

The ewe gave birth to 2 lambs(?) for him - the two of them are suckling lambs.  

11: [ud₅ maš₂] <3>-am₃ mu-na-u₃-tu 3-a-bi ešgarx!(MUNUS.GAR₃)-am₃
NOTE: it is possible that there is an AŠ₂ squeezed between MUNUS and GAR₃, but if so it wasn't written very clearly. 

[The goat] gave birth to 3 [kids] for him - the three of them are female kids. 

12: [(u₈) 2 sila₄] <*ŋi₆>-ga mu-na-u₃-tu 2-a-bi kir₁₁-am₃

The ewe gave birth to 2 black lambs for him - the two of them are suckling lambs.

13: [(ud₅) 3 maš₂] babbar₂-ra mu-na-u₃-tu 3-a-bi ešgarx-am₃

The goat gave birth to 3 white kids for him - the three of them are female kids.

14: [. . .] <ša₃>?-*ba amaš nu-me-a ŋiškiši₁₆(U₂.GIR₂) mu-na-ab-la₂
Kramer interprets this and the following lines to refer to the abundance produced being so great that there was not enough space in the sheepfold and elsewhere to store all of it, and translates this line: "[The milk] inside them--there being no sheepfold--was spread out for him over the ašagu-shrubs".
Compare VAT 6077 obv. col. iii 10: <ga> ša₃-ba-da? amaš nu-me-a kiši₁₆-e mu-na-ab-la₂  

[The milk?] in its midst, there being no sheepfold, was suspended over the thistles for him.

15: [. . .] <x> a-eštub nu-me-a a-gar₃-ra mu-na-an-de₂
NOTE: under the entry to a-gar₃ in PSD, there are numerous references to carp-flooded waters covering arable fields, and image of carp-waters in arable fields seems to be one of life-giving abundance, which complicates Kramer's interpretation of this passage.¬
VAT 6077 col. iii 11: ga-a-u₂ a-eštub nu-me-a a-gar₃-e mu-na-an-de₂

[The ...-plant milk], there being no carp flood, was poured out in an arable field for him.  

16: [ga-i₃]-<ti>-ir-da <gu₂>-[en]-<na> nu-me-a ki-in-dar mu-un-na-ab-tar
VAT 6077 col. iii 12: ga i-ti-<ir>-da gu₂-en-na nu-me-a ki-in-dar mu-na-ab-tar
NOTE: as noted by the editors of CT 58, this same line also occurs in Sumerian Proverbs coll. 3, 7. Alster Proverb p.80 translates: "The iterdum-milk, although it isn't river mud, cleaves the ground" (as a proverb for wealth going to waste). See Alster Prov. II p.377 for commentary with further treatments of the line. Another possibility would be to read "ku₅" 'cut into' instead of "tar" 'divert'. Again the image appears to be waste and lack, instead of surplus and abundance, as Kramer suggests. Civil in AuOr 1 (1983): 50 translates: "the itirda-milk, without being river mud, has been diverted into the cracks of the ground".

The iterda-milk, there being no river sediment, was diverted into the crevices.

17: [. . .] <*ar₃>? *tur-<tur>? [x x (x) (x)] <x>-*du₈ *sipa-*ra <*amaš>-*a-*na
VAT 6077 col. iii 13: ga-ar₃ tur-tur du₆-še₃ mu-na-du₈ <ŋuruš>?-e  
See Civil FI (1994): 97 for this line and the next. Note also his suggestion that PA in the next line may be to be read "duru₆" for ŋidru = 'staff'. However, in p.108 n.131, Civil assigns BM 80758 to the same tablet as VAT 1387 (VS 2, 30) + N 100 (a tablet which he must have mistakenly numbered the wrong way, since N 100 is an Old Akkadian administrative text), and cites the duplicate line: ga-ra de-de-el su-ur₂-ši mu-na-nu ga-ra gal-gal su-ur₂-ši mu-na-nu. Since the beginnings of these two lines (and the line that corresponds to the preceding line, l.16) are preserved in VAT 1387 rev. iv 2'-4', but not at all in BM 80758, it was probably a mistake to assign BM 80758 to the same tablet. Since I couldn't identify the tablet with the second half of these lines, however, it is possible that there is a tablet that joins VAT 1387 and contains the second halves of these duplicate lines.

The little cheeses he piled up for him in heaps - for the shepherd, in his sheepfold.

18: [. . .] nu₂ {d}dumu-zi-ra amaš-a-na
VAT 6077 col. iii 14: ga-ar₃ gal-gal pa-še₃ mu-na-nu₂ ŋuruš-e edin-na

[The large cheeses] he laid down [for him on sticks(?)] - for Dumuzi in his sheepfold.

19: [. . .] un-la₂ u₅ za₃-še₃ mu-un-la₂
NOTE: this and the following lines are not parallel to the lines following the preceding passage in VAT 6077. Kramer compares this passage to in Ni 2377a (SLTN 35) = Dumuzi-Inana C1 col. i 25-28, where Dumuzi comes bearing milk, oil, and other gifts on his shoulder and in his hands.

He carried [. . .], he carried oil on his shoulder.

BM 80758 (CT 58, 8):
Middle fragment, probably from a multi-column tablet. Different format that the group of single column tablets written in a highly syllabic orthography.
See also the transliteration of BM 96692 (CT 58, 7), which duplicates part of this tablet, which includes a score of the overlapping lines. With the exception of the first five preserved lines, the remaining lines preserved on the obverse of BM 80758 duplicate BM 96692 obv. 16'-rev.1, at which point the lines on the obverse of BM 80758 break off, making it impossible to determine any further correspondences. The lines on the obverse of BM 80758 are included in the score of BM 96692, but since the preserved lines on the reverse do not seem to correspond to the preserved content of BM 80758, they are transliterated separately here:

NOTE: GAM can mean either "to carry away" or "to bow down", usually in the negative sense of to be laid low, but also less negatively as to bown down in obeisance. Here it is being assumed that the form is an imperative an refers to what the audience is supposed to do after the invocation of each of the deities in the passage, but other interpretations are also possible.

... bow down!

10: [ki]-<sikil> {d}inana gam-mu

Young maiden, Inana, bow down!

NOTE: Lines that begin with the same phrases that occur in lines 10, 12, and 13, occur in the same sequence in other texts, but never include a line like Dumuzi, it is possible that ki-sikil was mistakenly repeated and that the addition of this line is erroneous. Compare, however, lines 15-16, where l.16 repeats the previous line, adding only Dumuzi.

NOTE: this restoration is based on the occurrence of dili-ni ur-saŋ-ŋa₂ as the sixth name of Inana in Uruamairabi Tablet 21, l.85 (see Volk 249 for the commentary to the line with this epithet) and the likelihood that no more than one or two signs could have preceded "ni" in the break at the beginning of the line.

17: *egi₂ ga-ša-an e₂-an-na gam-mu

18: su₈-ba {d}dumu-zi-da gam-mu
NOTE: Cohen and Fritz both assume that the -da after {d}dumu-zi is not an error, but Fritz (2003: 110 n.407) translates "die des Hirten Dumuzi" instead of "shepherd of Dumuzi", like Cohen. Note also that this epithet of Dumuzi, and many of the others that occur in the following lines also occur in similar sequences in other Dumuzi laments, including BM 15821 obv. 6f. (an Ershemma to Dumuzi), BM 109167 obv. 3f. (an Ershemma to Dumuzi parallel to BM 15821), VAT 6085 obv. 3f., and other Dumuzi laments. Since su₈-ba {d}dumu-zi never occurs as a genetive construction in any of these passages, I am assuming that -da is an error here.

4: še *5 *gur *5 gur a-u₃ he₂-em-me-en-dib₂-dib₂-be₂
NOTE: following the entries to a-u₃(-a) in PSD, there are at least three possibilities for interpreting "a-u₃" in this and the following lines -- there is the expression a-u₃-a which occurs in laments as an expression of woe, the use of the term to refer to a class of cultic officials that occurs together with the nar-gal and gala in Proto-Lu, and a lexeme meaning "high water". Cohen opts for the latter, and as an image of abundance, this would be appropriate. The only thing that is troubling about this interpretation is that in nearly all of the occurrences listed in PSD a-u₃ occurs with -ba and stands in a genitival relation to a named body of water, which is not the case here. Since the other two possibilities are equally problematic, however, this interpretation is adopted tentatively here.

So that they bring in 5 gur by 5 gur of grain (as) a high flood.

5: <udu> ŠA₃ maš₂! li-um 7-am₃ a-*u₃! he₂-em-me-en-dib₂-dib₂-be₂
NOTE: Cohen's reading of the sign after "ša₃" as "amaš" is epigraphically impossible, as the sign after ša₃ is clearly MAŠ₂ (or KUN) and not amaš. Another (albeit very unlikely) possibility is to read udu-utua!(AMAŠ) instead of ŠA₃.MAŠ₂, but this is a bit of a stretch.

So that they bring in seven writing boards (recording deliveries) of sheep (as) a high flood.

6: u₈ sig₅-ga-zu 7 ma-na-am₃ a-u₃ he₂-em-me-en-dib₂-dib₂-be₂

So that they bring in seven shekels(?) of your finest ewe (wool?) (as) a high flood.

7: a-u₅ he₂-em-me-en-*+dib₂!(SIG₇)-*+dib₂!(SIG₇)-*+be₂!(GA) he₂-em-me-en-dib₂-dib₂-be₂ / ŋiš-gi-ŋal₂-bi-im
NOTE: the first pair of signs read as "dib₂", in contrast to the second pair, have a clear Winkelhaken or diagonal wedge inside the sign, and the sign following them appears to have a small vertical inside the sign, in contrast to "bi" at the end of the line, which does not, suggesting that the sign is to be read -ga instead of -bi. But since it is unlikely that a verbal form with he₂- would be nominalized, and because "SIG₇" makes very little sense, Cohen's interpretation that the same verbal form is repeated twice here is tentatively adopted. Another possibility, though, might be to interpret -a as a short form of -am₃ and translating: "Because the high flood was verdant (with life), they brought (all of the previously listed things) in (to the temple).   
NOTE also that the occurrence of ŋiš-gi₄-ŋal₂ in a lament identified as a Balag is unusual, but interesting, since both ki-ru-gu₂ and ŋiš-gi₄-ŋal₂ notation also occur together in the city laments.

So that they bring them in, so that they bring them in, (as) a high flood - it is its Gishgigal.

Both halves of the tablet photographed in photo folder for July 2013; with collation notes made on another trip to Philadelphia. After closer inspection, however, it seems very unlikely that these two pieces belong to the same tablet.

NOTE: there *may be* a dividing line on the tablet in source B after this line - the tablet is ruled after many of the lines in this sources, and it is really difficult to determine whether this is a section ruling or just another line ruling.
NOTE: the line "me-na-gin₇ ma-a-a di-di" in VAT 605+ (VS 2, 25) obv. col. v l.43' as a single line marked off between two double dividing lines. For a discussion of this line and other sources in which it occurs both as a separate line and at the end of sections of laments see Krecher SKL p.192f., where he also notes that the literal translation of this line would be "wie wann gehe ich wohin?". See also SBH 3, rev. 6 for a bilingual example of this line. See also CBS 11393 + CBS 11389 obv. col. ii 7 and NBC 1313 rev. 12 (both sources for Dumuzi's Mother's Lament and the end of a section): ma-a-a-ba ama₅-na-gin₇ ma-a-a [di-di-in]

Obv.
1: i-bi₂ ku₃ a lu-lu ša₃-ba a-še-<*er> [su₃]
  NOTE: this incipit occurs in the OB Ershemma catalogues BM 23771 (B₂) l.3 and l.20, and BM 23701 (B₃) l.3 (see Cohen 1981, p.12, entry no.73 for references). PSD A (Pt.1), p.107 understands a-lu-lu as "(an exclamation)", but I wonder, since the expression only occurs in one other source, if it is possible to understand a lu-lu as a writing for a lu₃-lu₃ = 'to be smeared with tears', an expression which is attested in other laments (compare VAT 6085 rev. 16', among others), and which may be in appositional parallel to "su₃" at the end of the line.

Pure face, smeared with tears - woe fills its midst.

2: a lu-lu i-bi₂ ku₃ a lu-lu ša₃-ba a-<*še>-[er su₃]

&&BM 96680 (Aula Orientalis 5, 1987: 71-90), duplicates BM 96933, one of the source for Oh, Angry Sea, from rev. col. iii on.
Note: since the source was only published by Kramer in photo, it is not possible to determine from his transliteration where the column divisions are. CHECK original. The approximate place where each column ends can be estimated from the photo, however.
From the photograph of the tablet taken in the British Museum it is clear that there are numerous signs, particularly in the more broken parts of the tablet, that are difficult to make out, but which are not included at all in Kramer's transliteration of the source.

"My possessions which have been plundered by enemies!", they say.

"My treasure that has been carried off by enemies!", they say.

47: [(x)] <x> ma-al-la-<*ŋu₁₀> <*ma>-<al>?-<*la>-ŋu₁₀ ma-a *gig-ŋu₁₀
NOTE: "gig" at the end of the line is reasonably, but not entirely certain.

"My ... which has been established, which has been established, where is my ...?"

48: a uru₂ a uru₂ a me-e <mu>-<lu>-bi nu-men₃

"Woe city! Woe city! Woe! - Its one, I am not!"

"In its nooks, its turtledove, I am not!"

NOTE: for the identification of buru₅-habrudmušen as a partridge, and its occurrence with tumušen in this and other contexts, see Veldhuis 2004: 231-33.

"In its holes, its partridge, I am not!"

51: <bur₂>?-<ra>?-<ah>?-*bi su-dinmušen-bi nu-men₃
NOTE: the reconstruction of the first three signs is based more on the occurrence of bats with the bur₂-ra-ah in VS 2, 25 col. iii 7 and the passage cited in the commentary to this line in SKL p.175 than on the traces of the preserved signs, which do not unambiguously support this reading. Another possibly would be to read du₆-da-du₆-da, but this is even less likely on the basis of the preserved traces.

"The bats of its nooks, I am not!"

52: [(x)] <x> <x> še am₃-ša₄ ša₃-ŋu₁₀ še am₃-ša₄
NOTE: ša₃-ŋu₁₀ is not possible at the beginning of the line, on the basis of the preserved traces.

'The river of joy, the pure river groans!"

57: [i₇-de₃] i7kir₁₁(MUNUS.SILA₄)-sig-e še am₃-ša₄
NOTE: although epigraphically certain, the reason for Kramer's translation of i7kir₁₁-sig as the "Isinitu-canal" is entirely unclear to me, and I was unable to find a reference to this canal in Edzard's ZZB or in the RGTC volume for the OB period.

"The river, the Isinitu-canal, groans!"

"The river, the Euphrates, groans!"

"My heart, eater of plants, eat! eat!"

18: ša₃-ŋu₁₀ u₄-ri-še₃ ku₂-a ku₂-a

"My heart, eat, eat, eternally!"

19: u₂ ba-an-ze₂-eŋ₃-e u₂ na-ma-ku₂-e
NOTE: Beginnng with this line, col. ii 19-23 is repeated verbatim in col. iv 7-11 and is duplicated in identical form in BM 96933 col. iv 24'-28', with a possible shift in person from 1st to 2nd. Alternately, the line could be translated: "Even when I am given food, I do not eat it." (Same applies to the next line).

"When I give food, nobody eats it."

20: a ba-<ni>-<in>-de₂ a na-ma-na₈-na₈

"When I give water, nobody drinks it."

21: i-bi₂ u₃ nu-un-ti i-bi₂ u₃ nu-ma-al
NOTE: Kramer's translation of i-bi₂ u₃ as "tears" seems to be based on the "u₃-a" and "u₃-u₈" and the like occurring as expressions of woe, but even if this is not correct, I cannot find a better interpretation of this phrase. Note also the variant -de₂ for -ti in the parallel line in BM 96933 col. iv 26'. 

"Nobody cries, there is no water on their faces."

22: KU.KU-a-ba u₄ ba-an-ta-zal

"I pass time in its dwelling places."

23: šu-dul-šu-dul-la u₄ im-ma-ni-ku₄
NOTE: the parallel line in BM 96693 col. iv 28' has "u₂" instead of "u₄", which would result in the translation: "I cause food to be eaten in hidden places", though the image of light not entering into hidden places makes just as much, if not more sense.

"Light enters into the protected places(?)."

29:  ku₃? {d}inana? men₃? a-ra-li <men₃> šeš-ta gi₁₆-le-eŋ₃-ŋa₂ men₃
NOTE: the first three signs in the line are far from certain, and could read "ki u₅? <x> a-ra-li men₃ etc. Either way, however, the first sign in the line is definitely not "ŠI", as the first sign appears to be in BM 96933 rev. col. iii 1'.

"I, holy Inana, of Arali, I am; one who has lost her brother, I am."

30: ga-ša-an-an-na šeš-ta gi₁₆-le-eŋ₃-ŋa₂ men₃ / traces of 6-7 signs KU?.KU? 
Note: beginning with this line (l.28), this is the point of the text that overlaps with BM 96933 rev. col. iii forward. There are traces of three signs in the line preceding col. iii l.2' in this source, but since they do not really look like they belong to "ku¬₃ {d}inana", it is assumed that the first preserved line in col. iii does not overlap with this section of the text.

An entry for this verb is also listed by Attinger on p.248 of his AK article (pt. II), where he translates the verb "rend les coeurs lointains", but cites Volk's discussion on p.148 of his Inana and Shukaletuda edition, where Volk translates the verb as "die Gemueter der Menschen trostlos machen". In the passage cited, it is the raven, acting on the word of Enlil, who cause the action to take place. Clearly something negative is intended.

Note also that in this and the following lines Kramer reads al-di-di-in in BM 96680, but looking at the photograph, it really looks like the scribe only wrote al-di-di in every line. It is possible that there was wear on the tablet edge that is not visible on the photograph, but it really does look as if there was not an additional sign after "di-di" in these lines.

NOTE: the sign that Kramer read as "LU" is too wide to be "LU" and looks much more like "e₂" or "lil₂". Note also that "na" is possible, but not completely certain.

He/she/I received ... 

37: *e₂-*ŋu₁₀ *u₃-<*mu>-<un>?-<bi>? <ama>? *mar-*ra
NOTE: the sign before "mar" clearly has a "GA₂" frame, but it seems too wide to be "ŋa₂" and also very probable that there is an inscribed sign inside the frame - "ama" is just a guess though.

"My house for which its lord ... was placed."

38: *u₃-*u₈-*u₃-*u₈ <*x> [x x (x)] <*u₃>-*mu-un-bi ba-ug₅

"Woe, woe ... its lord has been killed."

NOTE: it is possible that the sign read as "TE" is "ub", but "te" is almost equally likely.

"My treasure ... its lord has sailed away."

40: *u₃-*u₈-*u₃-*u₈ *e [x x] *ba-*ba *ga-*ga-*da

"Woe, woe ... given [to me?], so that it is carried away(?)"

It is the 20th Kirugu.

43: *eŋ₃ *ni₂-*zu *a-*gin₇ *bi₂-*AK *eŋ₃ *ni₂-*zu *a-*gin₇ *bi₂-*AK
NOTE: VAT 1472 (VS 2, 59) obv. 10'-13' seems to have a phonetic duplicate of this section of the text. Note also that the corresponding lines also begin after a dividing line on the tablet, suggesting that the Kirugus in both sources are similar or identical.
  VAT 1472 obv. 10': eŋ₃ ni-zu e₂-gi bi-a eŋ₃ ni-zu e₂-gi bi-a
NOTE: this and the following lines are treated in Gabbay HES 1: 54f. He was unaware of the parallel to VAT 1472, and in a few places he has a different understanding of the reading and meaning of the line.

How have you yourself done this? How have you yourself done this?

44: mu-gi₁₇-ib ga-ša-an-an-*na *ni₂-zu a-gin₇ bi₂-AK
  VAT 1472 obv. 11': mu-gi₁₇-ib ga-ša-an-na eŋ₃ ni-zu e₂-gi bi-a

Mistress, Inana, how have you yourself done (this)?

  VAT 1472 obv. 12': egi₂ ga-ša-an e₂-an-na eŋ₃ ni-zu e₂-gi bi-a

Princess, lady of the Eanna, how have you yourself done (this)?

46: *egi₂ *ga-ša-an ki unug{ki}-*ga *ni₂-zu a-gin₇ bi₂-AK
  VAT 1472 obv. 13': <*eŋ₃> <x> [. . .]
NOTE: rest of the obverse is broken after this line in VAT 1472. Note also that it is possible that the first sign in the line is "egi₂" followed by another sign, but the next sign is definitely not "ga", and the sign really does look more like "eŋ₃" than "egi₂".

Princess, lady of Uruk, how have you yourself done (this)?

47: *egi₂ ga-ša-an ki zabalam*{ki} *ni₂-zu a-gin₇ bi₂-AK
BM 96933 rev. iv 1': [ga-ša-an-an-na] <zabalam><{ki}> <eŋ₃> [x x]

BM 96933 rev. iv 2': [ga-ša-an dingir igi zi] <bar>-ra eŋ₃ ni₂-zu 
NOTE: there seems to be traces of a sign after "an" (possibly "na"?) in BM 96680, but it is probably more likely that no sign was intended here.

Lady, goddess who looks truly upon, how have you yourself done (this)?

49: ga-ša-an dingir ir₉ mah-a ni₂-zu a-gin₇ bi₂-AK
BM 96933 rev. iv 3': [ga-ša-an dingir] <ir₉> mah-a eŋ₃ ni₂-zu
  NOTE: Gabbay reads {d}ŋir₃-mah-a for dingir ir₉ mah-a, but leaves the word untranslated.

Lady, mighty and exalted goddess, how have you yourself done (this)?

50: *eŋ₃ *ni₂-*zu *a-*gin₇ '' *nu-*zu-*a-*e

BM 96933 rev. iv 5': [. . .] <x>-e eŋ₃-ŋu₁₀-uš *HAB₂-e
  NOTE: it is possible that eŋ₃-ŋu₁₀-uš should be read am₂-mu-uš and understood as a phonetic writing of am₃-mu-uš 'for a third time'.

Nobody knows how you yourself did this.

51: *eŋ₃ *dam *sa₆-*ga '' nu-zu-a-e
BM 96933 rev. iv 6': [x] <dam>? sa₆-ga nu-zu-a-e

BM 96933 iv 10': [. . .] <BI>?.GIŠ.PAD.SI *mu-*lu *si-*a-*ba! *nu-*mu-*ni-*bal-*e

Nobody crosses over (the river) in a ferry after it has been loaded.

BM 96933 col. iv 11': [. . .] <*x>-*ba *mušen-*du₃-*e *sa *ba-*an-*gi

For my city that has been plundered, the fowler has spanned a net(trap).

56: *mušen-*du₃ *šir₃-*ra *ga-*nam *na-*nam *ul₄-*ul₄ *sa *bi₂-*in-*du₃
NOTE: on the photograph the sign read by Kramer as "gi₄" looks much more like "du₃" or "ir", and is definitely not "gi₄".
BM 96933 col. iv 12': [. . .] <*ga>-<*nam> *na-*nam <*ul₄>-<*ul₄> *sa₂ *bi₂-*in-*gi₄

The fowler, hurrying with chain "Let me, let me not", pulls the net away(?)

57: ša₃-ba na-aŋ₂-tar-ŋu₁₀ ga-nam na-nam *+e₂-gi₄-a ma-ni-in-du₃
BM 96933 col. iv 13': *ša₃-*ba *nam-<*tar>-<*ŋu₁₀> *ga-*nam na-nam *e₂-*gi-*a ma-ni-in-*du₃

In its midst, my fate "let me, let me not", he placed as a bride for me.

58: me-e eŋ₃ ni₂-ŋu₁₀ ba-ra-mu-un-AK a-a-ŋu₁₀ mu-un-AK
Gabbay translates this line: "But I, myself, have not done this! My father Enlil has done (this)!", which is perhaps a better translation.
BM 96933 col. iv 14': *me-*e *eŋ₃ *ni₂-*ŋu₁₀ *ba-*ra-*an-*ga a-a-*ŋu₁₀ *mu-*un-*AK

So that I would not have to do it myself, my father did it.

59: a-a-ŋu₁₀ {d}mu-ul-lil₂-le a-a-ŋu₁₀ mu-un-<AK>?
BM 96933 col. iv 15': *a-*a-*ŋu₁₀ {d}mu-ul-lil₂-*le *mu-*AK a-a-ŋu₁₀ *mu-*AK
BM 96933 col. iv 16': *kur-*gal {d}mu-ul-lil₂-le *mu-*AK a-a-ŋu₁₀ *mu-*AK

My father Enlil did it, my father did it.
BM 96933 adds: The great mountain Enlil did it, my father did it.

60: su₃-ra₂-aŋ₂ ku₄-ku₄-de₃ mu-un-AK a-a-ŋu₁₀ mu-un-<AK>?
BM 96933 col. iv 17': *su₃-*ra₂-*aŋ₂ *ku₄-*ku₄-*de₃-*en *a-*a-*ŋu₁₀ *mu-*AK
So that shining light would come forth, he did it, my father did(?) it.

He cut barley, and he made my flock of birds fly away.
BM 96933: My father, he did bitter things - the great mountain, Enlil.
  NOTE: In BM 96933 this line is followed by a double dividing line with Kirugu notation immediately following it: ki-ru-gu₂ 28-kam-ma "It is the 28th Kirugu."

When is the Tigris and the Euphrates to be cooled?

6: [ša₃ buru₅mušen-gin₇] *ba-*e-*gub-*ba-*zu
BM 96933 col. iv 22': *ša₃ *buru₅*mušen-*gin₇ ba-e-*gub-*ba-*e
NOTE: cf. BM 96933 obv. i 16-17, which has lines that are very similar to this line and the next, but where the gate and the bolt that are being placed by Inana are compared to her angry heart. It is therefore likely that "ša₃" in this line also refers to Inana's heart, and not to a "swarm" of sparrows.

You who place your heart there like a flock of sparrows.

7: [ŋišsi-ŋar kalag-ga] ba-e-mar-ra-zu
BM 96933 col. iv 23': ŋišsi-ŋar kalag-ga ba-e-*mar-*ra-*še₃

NOTE also that beginning with this line, l.8-12 are identical to col. ii 19-23 = BM 96933 col. iv 24'-28', with the possible exception of a shift from 1st to 2nd person here.

When you give food, nobody eats it.

Mother, mistress, when will your heart finally cease its lamenting?

3: mu-gi₁₇-ib ga-ša-*an-*na ša₃-zu a-še-er-bi
  NOTE: there is no blank space at the end of the line after a-še-er-bi, but it is clear from the context that the verb in the previous line was repeated.

Mistress, Inana <<when will>> your heart <<cease>> its lamenting?

4: ga-ša-an e₂-an-na ša₃-zu a-še-er-bi

Lady of the Eanna, <<when will>> your heart <<cease>> its lamenting?

  NOTE: -zu-še₃ is possible, but the signs on the tablet really do look more like "ba-TUG₂".

Princess, ... , <<when will>> your heart <<cease>> its lamenting?

10: *mu-*gi₁₇-*ib *ša₃ *e₂-*zu-*še₃ am₃-ši-ma-al-la-zu-še₃

Mistress, because you set your mind to your city.

12: *ša₃ *e₂ *hul-*a-*zu! *uru₂ *hul-*a-*zu! am₃-ši-ma-al-la-zu-še₃
NOTE: the signs read as "zu" are clearly "zu" but they were either written over another sign, or the scribe added extra vertical wedges to the middle the sign each time it was written - a third possibility is that this was intended to indicate an erasure.

Because you set your mind to your destroyed house, to your destroyed city.

13: ša¬₃ *dam-*bi nu-mu-un-til₃-la-zu am₃-ši-ma-al-la-*zu-*še₃

Because you set your mind to its spouse who no longer lives.

Your densely clustered houses which nobody can enter.

19: *e₂-*a *a-*a-*am₃ '' *dingir? *pad₃-<*pad₃>-*zu
NOTE: pad₃-pad₃ is likely, but there is also definitely another sign, consisting of two or three wedges, before the first "pad₃". The meaning of this line is completely unclear, though.

In your houses, where elders have been appointed gods(?).

20: *en *nu *u₄ '' kukku₂(MI.MI) ŋal₂-la-zu

(Where) your owners have no daylight and have been given (only) night.

In (those distant) days when the wife was given to a stranger. 

29 (17): ŋi₆ dumu kur₂-re ba-an-ze₂-eŋ₃-ŋa₂-[ta] (= OAS l.17)

In (those distant) nights, when the son was given to a stranger. 

30 (18): ma-la-<*gin₇> <*e₂> <*lul>-*la *dam *i₃-*ug₅-[ga-ta] (= OAS l.18)

NOTE: Anne has a photo of BM 132095, but it is not possible to determine from it whether the scribe wrote TUG₂.LUL.NA from it.

After the wife was killed like a girlfriend in a false house.

31 (19): <*dam> *i₃-<*ug₅> *dam *i₃-*ug₅-[ga-ta] (= OAS 1.19)

After the son was killed, the son was killed.

NOTE: it is not impossible that the traces of the signs in this line belong to "uru₂-zu hul-hul-lu-de₃ and that the second part of the corresponding line in BM 132095 was written as the second part of the line in the break following these traces, but other than the sign "de₃", which is relatively certain, it is not possible to determine from the photo where these signs were written or other signs.

NOTE: BM 96680 col. ii 41-46 contains lines that do not occurs in this source: the first five have the same verbal form as this line, but begin with different epithets of Inana; these lines are followed by col. ii l.46, which reads: "i₃-am₃-ma e-la-lu", and is followed by Kirugu notation for Kirugu 18. The following Kirigu, from beginning to end overlaps substantially with the following Kirugu (26) in this source.
 
"Mistress Inana [why don't you] set your eyes toward it?"

22': ga-ša-an-*ŋu₁₀ *e-*ne-*ŋu₁₀ ma-al i₃-di-di [. . .]
NOTE: Kramer (p.78) reads: ga-ša-an-ŋu₁₀ e-ne-<eŋ₃> mu-ma-al i₃-di-di [. . .], interpreting "mu" as a verbal prefix, instead of a possessive suffix (also in the next line) which could be translated: "My lady, you established the matter, (and) I keep wandering about", which makes just as little sense.

"My lady, my matter being settled, I keep wandering about."

23': ša₃ *ku₃-ŋu₁₀ e-ne-eŋ₃-ŋu₁₀ ma-al i₃-di-di [. . .]

NOTE: Kramer reads "ŠEŠ" instead of "MU" at the end of the second half of the line, but the photo seems to have a very clear "MU" here. It also seems clear in the repetition of this line in l.10.
NOTE: in BM 96933 it is possible that uru₂-a has been intentionally scratched out by the scribe.

"I want to walk, I want to keep walking, I, Inanna, I, indeed, from the man ..."

BM 96680 col. iii 4: lu₂-*ra *pa₄-*hal-*la *nu₂-*a-*gin₇ *mu-*na-*te-*ŋa₂-*de₃-*en 
NOTE: from this point on BM 96693 diverges completely from BM 96680, which in col. iii 10-20 has different lines, which are followed by Kirugu notation for Kirugu 19. After this section the lines in the two sources begin to overlap again.

"As if to one who is lying motionless(?), I will approach him."

32': *a-*a-ŋu₁₀ kur-ra *a-*a-ŋu₁₀ kur-ra *a-*a-ŋu₁₀ <*DU>? [. . .]
NOTE: the traces of the last preserved sign in the line definitely do not belong to "KUR", which rule out Kramer's reconstruction of the end of the line as [kur-ra], and "ŋar" is also very unlikely, but "DU" is just a guess, and not enough of the sign is preserved to determine with certainty which sign it is. Another possibility, in this and the following lines, would be to understand "mu" as the noun "name", and not as a possessive suffix that goes with "a-a", which would result instead in a translation along the lines of: "Father! a name in the netherworld, father! a name in the netherworld, [he established]".
BM 96680: omits

"My father, in the mountain, my father, in the mountain, my father [. . .]"

33': *a-*a-ŋu₁₀ kur-ra *mu-*ni-*in-*ŋar-<ŋar>? [. . .]
NOTE: the second "ŋar" is consistent with the traces of the last preserved sign in the line, but is not entirely certain.
BM 96680: omits

"My father, he placed (them/it) in the mountain"

34': *a-*za-*lu-*lu-ŋu₁₀ kur-ra mu-ni-in [. . .]
NOTE: PSD reconstructs the verb as "ŋar-ŋar" and takes "a-za-lu-lu-ŋu₁₀" as the agent of the verb (and also takes a-a-ŋu₁₀ as the agent of "ŋar-ŋar" in the previous line), but it leaves the object of the verb unspecified. a-za-lu-lu "multitude of living creatures" also occurs in EnA 128.
BM 96680: omits

"My teeming multitude (of living things), in the mountain he [placed]?"

38': ki-ru-gu₂ 26 kam-ma [. . .]
BM 96680 col. iii 20: [ki-ru-gu₂ 19]-*kam-*ma-*am₃ 
NOTE: the lines that precede this Kirugu notation in BM 96680 differ from the lines that end the Kirugu in BM 96680, but both sources seem to begin the next Kirugu with the same line.

It is the 26th Kirugu.

39': *al-*di-*di *ama *{d}*inana *al-*di-*di-<*in> 
BM 96680 col. iii 21 (Kramer 379): [. . .] *al-*di-*di[-in]? 
  NOTE: this is the first line of Kirugu 27 in BM 96933. Note also that in this and the following lines Kramer reads al-di-di-in in BM 96680, but looking at the photograph, it really looks like the scribe only wrote al-di-di in every line. It is possible that there was wear on the tablet edge that is not visible on the photograph, but it really does look as if there was not an additional sign after "di-di" in these lines.

"Wandering about, mother Inana, you are wandering about."

40': u₃-u₈ u₃-u₈ *e-*la-*lu *ama {d}inana al-di-di-<in>

NOTE: there seems to be traces of a sign after "an" (possibly "na"?) in BM 96680, but it is probably more likely that no sign was intended here.

"Lady, goddess who looks truly upon, how have you yourself done (this)?"

NOTE: compare BM 96680 col. iii 6: am₃-mu-uš-kam-ma-ŋu₁₀ mu-un-ši-ib₂-us₂, which may support interpreting "eŋ₃-ŋu₁₀-uš" in this line as a phonetic writing for "am₃-mu-uš" as a possibility (albeit an unlikely one, especially since the corresponding line in BM 96680 is preceded by a line with i-im-men₃ 'for the second time').

"... for the third time(?) ..."

6': [x] <dam>? *sa₆-*ga *nu-*zu-*a-*e
BM 96680 col. iii 51: *eŋ₃ *dam *sa₆-*ga '' nu-zu-a-e
NOTE: in this line and the next the sign before "sa₆" is almost completely broken, making it impossible to determine what sign it is.

"Nobody knows how the beautiful spouse did this."

BM 96680 iii 58: me-e eŋ₃ ni₂-ŋu₁₀ ba-ra-mu-un-AK a-a-ŋu₁₀ mu-un-AK
Gabbay translates this line: "But I, myself, have not done this! My father Enlil has done (this)!", which is perhaps a better translation.

"So that I would not have to do it myself, my father did it."

NOTE: this is the end of the column in BM 96680, and this line is followed by a double dividing line in BM 96933. Note also that a short kirugu (numbered Kirugu 21) follows in BM 96680, which is not included in BM 96933.

"My father, he did bitter things - the great mountain, Enlil".

NOTE: cf. BM 96933 obv. i 16-17, which has lines that are very similar to this line and the next, but where the gate and the bolt that are being placed by Inana are compared to her angry heart. It is therefore likely that "ša₃" in this line also refers to Inana's heart, and not to a "swarm" of sparrows.

You who place your heart there like a flock of sparrows.

23': ŋišsi-ŋar kalag-ga ba-e-*mar-*ra-*še₃

Double-dividing line on the tablet followed by the colophon:

It is the end. Balag of Inana.  From the mouth of Shamashmuballit, son of Arad-Nanna.

NOTE: BM 96680 has one additional line before the end of the Kirugu and the end of the composition, which reads: [. . .] e₂-a u₄ [. . .] "... in the house ...". This line is then followed by a double dividing line and the colophon: [ki]-*šu₂-*bi-[im] "It is the end." // [balaŋ] {d}inana-[kam] "Balag of Inana.", and then the rest of the column is uninscribed.

Text No. 40: Unpublished Dumuzi-Inana Ershemma

&&MAH 15995 (unpublished - photos CDLI, Volk, and Loehnert): note this tablet is a landscape-shaped tablet, with the same format as some of the other landscape-shaped tablets containing liturgical compositions in the BM, and like these other tablets there is space left between the last sign and the right tablet edge in every line which is not noted in every instance in the transliteration below. Note also that on the reverse the right side of the tablet is damaged making it impossible to determine whether this space had been left blank or whether there were signs there. The obverse is clear in the CDLI photo, but the top half of the reverse, and in particular the left half of the tablet on the reverse, was not photographed as well, making it difficult to read in places.

obv.
1: [x x] <ba> [. . .] su₈-ba [. . .] 
NOTE: the right corner of the tablet is broken, making it impossible to determine whether there was a verbal form at the end of the line that was repeated in the following lines, given the tendency of the scribe to leave the last quarter of the line blank, however, this seems unlikely.

... the shepherd ...

2: [su₈]-<ba> {d}dumu-[zi] [(x) (x) (x) (x) (x)] su₈-ba [. . .]

The shepherd Dumuzi ... the shepherd ...

3: <su₈>-ba i₃-me-[a] [(x) (x)] '' *i₃-ŋin-na(-)ka <<b.s.>>
  NOTE: BM 96691 (an Enlil lament) rev. iv' 3'-4' begin with the same signs as this and the following lines, but unfortunately all but the beginnings of these lines are broken in that source, making it impossible to reconstruct any further parallels. Since "ka" is written immediately after "na" in this line and the next, the translation assumes that KA belong to the verbal form and is the suffix -(a)ka - 'as soon as'. But since this interpretation is difficult to reconcile with the verbal prefixes i₃- and ga- the possibility should be left open that this is the first sign in a compound verbal form that was omitted in the blank space that follows because it was inferable.

The mother(?) returned to the sheepfold, they had made the sheepfold quiet. 

9: *amaš-zu amaš-a '' mu-un-gub-gub-bu-ne

Your sheepfold! They are standing in the sheepfold!

10: *amaš-zu amaš-a '' mu-un-dur₂-dur₂-ne

Your sheepfold! They are dwelling in your sheepfold!

11: u₄ mu-un-zu ša₃ mu-un-da-*zu!(SU)-*zu!(SU)
NOTE: unlike the other "zu" signs on this tablet, which have only a single horizontal and vertical wedge inside the sign, the two signs at the end of the line have at least three vertical wedges and possibly two horizontal wedges, making the sign look more like "su" than "zu". The significance of this is unclear, and maybe another verb was intended here.

She knew the day, she was able to determine its significance(?)

12: u₄-da zu-de₃ ul-la zu-de₃

Knowing at that time(?), knowing quickly,

13: *AN NE e₂? *dub-*bu-*ra *ba-*zu *zi-*ga-*am₃
NOTE: the signs at the beginning of the line are difficult to interpret. "NE" is completely certain, "AN" slightly less so, and "e₂" has the basic shape of "e₂" but the horizontal wedges at the beginning of the sign begin above the upper horizontal wedge and are not inside the sign, as they usually are for "e₂". Another possibility would be to interpret dub-bu-ra as the verbal form um-bu-ra, but this also make very little sense.

Text No. 41 - Unpublished Inana Lament

&&BM 100059 (see Kramer, PAPS 124: 299) = balag of Inana: bottom half of a multi-column (4-column) tablet. Note: the transliteration of this tablet was done very quickly, but since the photos are good, they can used to be correct many of the mistakes.
Measurements: 10.6+ in height, 10.8cm in width.

Partial transliteration and translation, because the photos are not always clear for every place on the tablet and the entire text needs to be studied again in the original.

Obv.
col. i
beginning of column broken - probably no more than 5-10 lines missing
1': [6-8 signs] <ke₄>? <ki>?-<bi>? [(x) (x)] <im>-<x> [. . .]

...

2': [. . .] <zi>?-<da>? <im/me>? A.<AN>? traces <in>?-<ra>
NOTE: the sign read as "da" looks a little more like "UŠ" than "da", but the broken sign before it is almost certainly "zi" or "gi", which is unlikely to have been followed by "UŠ". Note also that the sign read as "im" could me "ama" followed (possibly) by "me-en", or it could be "ni₂ <am₃> [. . .]"

...

3': <u₃>?-<mu>?-<un>? <*kur>-<*kur>-*ra-*ke₄ '' ni₂ i₃-ŋar ba-ni-in-ra
NOTE:although "kur-kur" is occasionally (but rarely) preceded by "ga-ša-an" in the lament, more often than not it is preceded by "u₃-mu-un" (referring to Enlil), which is consistent with the traces, but not definite, since the signs are largely broken. Note also that it is possible that the signs read as "NI.GAR" in this and the next two lines are "ra" - compare the second part of "ra" at the end of the line, which looks a lot like "ŋar".

The lord of the lands struck ... in ...

4': [x] <x> gi-gi kalam-ma?-a '' ni₂ i₃-ŋar ba-ni-in-ra
NOTE: it is possible, if not likely, that the sign read as "ma" is another sign, like "al", since it seems to have more wedges at the beginning than the other "ma" signs on the tablet. 

...

5': [x] <x> saŋ ŋi₆ mu-un-*til-*la ni₂ i₃-ŋar ba-ni-in-ra
NOTE: even though sipa saŋ ŋi₆-ga might be expected here (as an epithet of Enlil), the broken sign before "saŋ" looks more like "na" than the end of "sipa".

------ *possibly double-dividing line on tablet -------
NOTE: it seems very likely that there is a double-dividing line here, since a double-line is visible in the middle of the line (though less so at the beginning and end of the line)

10': <x> <x> e? a LAGAB?.LAGAB? '' KA?-a-ta mu-un-la₂
NOTE: the signs read as LAGAB look like they have faint traces of two horizontal wedges inside them, making it possible that the sign is mu₄ or a similar sign.

Note: scribe wrote columns iii and iv from left to right instead of from right to left, so that column four is on the right side of the reverse, contrary to the typical sequence.

  CBS 11151 iii 3: <me>-e <na>-mu-un-til₃-le (a line which duplicates the second half of the first line in this section of the text).

PRAK sources add before and after this line: For me, the house, the shrine of the mountain ... // My treasure house, the brickwork of Zabalam
My possession, my shrine, the Eanna.

Cavigneaux, ASJ 9: 54 who assumes that the first part of the next line is the second part of this line (which is a reasonable assumption, except that on the tablet this line is indented, albeit slightly, and the next line is positioned on the tablet like the beginning of a new line) and reads: "e₂-ŋu₁₀ eŋ¬₃-de₂?-de₂?-ŋu₁₀ / ba-ra-an-ku₄-ku₄-de₃-en: "My house which procures for me many things, I will no longer enter there."

Text No. 43: Inana and the Numun-Plant

&&BM 120011 (Wagensonner, WZKM 99 (2009): 355-76; Kramer 1980 - Gordon Fs.) - this text is also transliterated and translated by ETCSL (under the title "The Shumunda Grass"). Given the use of Emesal throughout the text, the theme of destruction, the presence of Inana and Dumuzi, and the division of texts into multiple sections, however, this text is almost certainly a lament.

Obv.
1: ab-ba na-mu-un-di ab-ba na-mu-<un>-[di]
NOTE: ETCSL and Wagensonner both assume that the verb in the line is na--de₅, but given the absence of any other phonetic writings in the text, and the frequency with which the first lines of sections of laments have verbal forms with the na- prefix, this seems very unlikelty.

The father does not go about, the father does not go about.

2: im ba-šeŋ₃-ŋa₂-ba e₂-ŋar₈ ba-gul-<la>-[ba]

When the rain fell and the walls were destroyed.

3: <šika> bar₇-bar₇-ra ba-šeŋ₃-ŋa₂-ba
NOTE: the occurrence of "flaming potsherds" also occurs in LSUr -- see Michalowski's edition l.79.

When the shards came flashing down and the rain fell.

4: lu₂-ra lu₂ gi₄-ba <<la₂>>? gaba ba-ri-a-ba

When a man turned to another man and opposed him.

5: mu du₁₁-ga-ba in-ga-an-du₁₁
NOTE: given the role of Enlil as the agent of destruction in many laments, it is tempting to take Enlil, who is perhaps the referent of ab-ba in the first line, as the unstated agent of some of the following transitive verbs in this passage. But since Dumuzi is eventually introduced, it is also possible that after this passage, the agent may switch to Dumuzi.

When there had been intercourse, he performed it as well.

6: mu ba-su-ub-ba-ba in-ga-an-su-ub

When there was kissing, he kissed as well.

7: u₄ im-e ŋa₂-e ga-šeŋ₃ im-mi-in-du₁₁-ga-<ba>

When he(Enlil?) said, "I, I want the wind to rain down".

8: u₄ e₂-ŋar₈-e ŋa₂-e ga-šeŋ₃ im-mi-in-du₁₁-ga-<ba>

When he said "I, I want to rain against the walls".

9: u₄ a-ma-ru ŋa₂-e ga-ur₃-ur₃ im-mi-in-du₁₁-ga-<ba>

When he said "I want to level (everything) with a flood".

10: an in-du₁₁ <<x>> ki in-tu-ud

The heaven acted and the earth gave birth.

11: u2šumunda(DU₆+DU₆.ŠE.SAR) in-ga-an-tu-ud

They gave birth to the shumunda-grass.

12: ki in-tu-ud an in-du₁₁

The earth gave birth and the heaven acted.

13: u2šumunda in-ga-an-tu-ud

They gave birth to the shumunda-grass.

14: gi lum-lum-ma-ni izi ba-an-la₂-la₂

His sprouting reeds were set on fire.

15: ri-a-ri-a-bi!(GA) gaba ba-ri-a-bi

Its strikers(?) and its ones who had been opposed(?)

16: um-ma u₄-da ba-ra-ab-tak₄-a
NOTE: as noted by Kramer and Wagensonner, this and the next two lines are directly paralled by lines in the Curse of Agade

Since the mother abandoned it on that day.

17: ab-ba u₄-da ba-ra-ab-tak₄-a

Since the father abandoned it on that day.

18: gala-mah mu-da ba-ra-ab-tak₄-a

Since the gala-mah abandoned it in that year.

19: mu-lu a-ma-ru-ta ba-ra-ab-tak₄-a

Since everyone abandoned it after the flood. 

20: u2šumunda kin-gi₄-a ba-an-gaz
ETCSL's interpretation of this line as "The shumunda grass crushed them with labor" is interesting, but grammatically and semantically implausible - the grass is not marked for agency, there is no reference to "them" anywhere, and "to crush with work" is a modern idiom.

The shumunda-grass destroyed all of the work.

21: kin-gi₄-a ba-an-gaz <sahar>-tu₁₁-bi ba-tuš
NOTE: as noted by Wagensonner in his commentary to this line, the theme of dwelling in debris also occurs in Enmerkar and Ensuhkeshdana and Inana and Enki.

The work was destroyed and lay in debris.

22 (10-mark): u2šumunda izi la₂-la₂ am₃-me u₂-du₃-a-ni nu-ub-be₂  
NOTE: ETCSL translates: "The shumunda grass is a fire carrier, he cannot be tied in bundles", but even with the animate suffix -ni here, it seems unlikely that the grass is being personified. It therefore seems probably that the subject is Dumuzi, or refers to people in general (i.e. "nobody could make his bundles"). In favor of the subject being neutral, however, it should be noted that the subject is not explicitly named as Dumuzi until the second second of the text, when all of these actions are repeated specifically with respect to him, so it is possible, if not likely, that this section sets the stage for what comes in the next section by describing what will happen to a person who will not be named until the second section.

(Since) the shumunda-grass was on fire, he could not make his bundles (with it). 

23: u₂ nu-mu-dub₂-dub₂-be₂ u₂ nu-mu-bu-bu-re

He could not pile up the grass, he could not rip out the grass.

24: u₂ nu-mu-bu-bu-re ma-e-ra ma-an-du₃ 
NOTE: the reading "ra" instead of "um(-ma-an-du₃)" takes Wagensonner's collation entirely on faith, but if this is correct the switch to 1st-person is very unusual and difficult to explain. Retaining "um" the line could be translated (still with difficulty): "when he planted it (in the ground) for a house", which would connect this line with the following line.

Since he could not rip out the grass, he planted it there for me.

25: tukum(ŠU.NIG₂.TUR.LA₂) mu-un-gub-be₂ tukum mu-un-nu₂-e

If he stands it up, if he lies it down.

26: izi um-ma-an-si₃ daŋal-ba ŋin-na-ni

When he set fire, it spread widely.

27: u2šumunda ki gub-ba-ni a-a mun₄-na

When he stands among the shumunda grass, it is a place of brackish water.

28: izi ga-ba-ŋar ga-ba-ŋar im-ma-ni-in-du₇-e

He butts about there (saying): "I want to start, I want to start a fire". 

29: ur₂ e₂-an-na-ke₄ izi im-ma-ni-ri

He set fire to the base of the Eanna.

30: šu im-ma-ni-in-du₃ šu im-ma-ni-in-la₂

He was fettered there, he was bound there.  

31: ka-ka-na um-ma-da-ŋal₂-la

When he was bound at the mouth,

32 (10-mark): ga-ša-an-an-na u2ugamušen ba-e-dab₅ ugu-ni-še₃ ba-gub
NOTE: ETCSL emends l.34 to make Inana the agent of the verb dab₅, but it seems just as likely that the raven (as an agent of evil, and possibly as a disguised form of Enlil) is doing the seizing here. In spite of the difficulties of the line, however, it seems very unlikely that Inana would place the raven on Dumuzi (and if this were the action then -še₃, toward, would be semantically incorrect).

A raven seized Inana there and it was standing by her head.

33: sipa-de₃ e-ze₂-ni ma-a-a-ba mu-da-ab-šub

The shepherd abandoned his sheep, where should they go(?). 

34: ga-ša-an-an-na-ra u2ugaga mušen ba-e-dab₅-ba

It was a raven that was seized there for Inana.

**there is a double-dividing line on the tablet here**

35: im ba-šeŋ₃-ŋa₂-ba e₂-ŋar₈ ba-gul-la-ba

When wind rained down and the walls were destroyed.

36: šika bar₇-bar₇-ra ba-šeŋ₃-ŋa₂-ba

When it rained down flaming potsherds.

37: {d}dumu-zi-de₃ gaba ba-ri-a-bi

It was Dumuzi who was opposed.

38: im ba-da-šeŋ₃ e₂-ŋar₈ ba-da-gul

The wind rained down on him, the walls were destroyed around him.

39: tur₃ ba-da-gul amaš ba-da-bu

The cattle-pen was destroyed around him, the sheepfold was ripped out around him.

40: i₇-da a-ŋi₆ hul <<x>> ba-an-da-šub

Wicked flood waves in the river crashed down on him.

41: ambar-ra im hul ba-an-da-šub

Wicked winds crashed down on him in the canebrake.

42 (10-mark): <gu₂>? <na>?-aŋ₂-GADA? i7idigna i7buruna-ke₄

... the Tigris and the Euphrates.

43: <i7>idigna i7buruna-<ke₄> u₂-gid₂-da ba-an-mu₂

Long grass grew on the Tigris and Euphrates.

Akk. ina bur-ti ša₂-di-i dil-mun qaq-qa-du am-si

In the wells of the land of Dilmun I bathe my head.

** Commentary Volk pp.158-159: discusses the inconclusive evidence for the reading of LAGABxU= burtu = 'well' as either pu₂ or tul₂. Note also that the later version adds a line before this one with forms in the Sumerian version which are difficult to interpret. Volk considers some of the possibilities on p.159. The Akkadian translation of the final phrase: "to soak in silt", however, is much clearer.

Akk. ina i-gu-za-an-ge-e uk-ta-an-ni

I ornament myself with a ... - stone.

** Commentary Volk pp.160-161: has a detailed list of the different writing of the stone named at the beginning of the line. The stone also occurs in Lugale 534 and MSL X, p.74 l.23 (the stone of Lugale), where it is written na4e-gi-za₃-ga. The meaning of the stone nevertheless remains uncertain.

Akk. be-le₂-ku ina qab-lu a-ša₂-as-si-ma

I, the lady, call out from all sides(?)

** Commentary Volk pp.161-162: discusses some of the difficulties of interpreting šab-šab in this line, noting that qablu can mean either "battle" or "middle". He decides to interpret it as "at both of its hips", understood to mean more generally, "nach beiden Seiten", but this seems like a bit of a stretch. He leaves the form sa-bar-bar in H 2, completely out of the discussion, though this may also have some bearing on the interpretation.

LV 27: šab kur-ra-ke₄ gu₃ u₃-ba-ni-in-de₂

Line omitted in H 2

(Then) the gods of the mountain stumble. 

** Commentary Volk pp.162-163: notes that the Akkadian translation of gi₁₆-le-eŋ₃ is from the verb egeeru = to lie over, to be crossed. From this he arrives at the translation: "(dann) straucheln die Goetter des Berglandes" 'then the gods of the mountain stumble'.

Akk. a-me-lu a-lap-pat-ma a-<me>?-[lu] [. . .] a-mi-il

When I touch a male, that male becomes a man.
** Volk Commentary p.179: Volk considers the possibility that lu₂/mu-lu in this line is in apposition to geme₂ 'maid/slave girl', and that the change that takes place here is from being a male slave to a free (awiilu) citizen.

29: e₂ mu-un-ku₄-ra-na e₂ saŋ mu-ze₂-bi
F (col. ii, l.7): e₂ mu [. . .]

Akk. E₂ e-ter-bu E₂ a-mi-li e-<DA> [. . .] <tum?/ib>? 

LV: In the house that I enter, the house of that man is a good house (?).

Note that this translation might work for the later version, but that the line in the OB version is more difficult to translate, especially since it is unclear what the connection between e₂ and saŋ might be and whether "mu" goes with "saŋ" and should be read "ŋu₁₀" or whether it goes with "ze₂" and should be read "mu". Either way the meaning remains uncertain.

30: mu-lu am₃-da-ŋal₂-la mu-lu-am₃ ku₃ ŋal₂-la
F (col. ii, l.8): <lu₂> <x> [. . .]
  Note rest of col. ii broken in source F

Akk. a-mi-il ah-ti-šu-šu : ah-tiš₂-<x> [. . .] <x> ri

When I appear with a man, that man is made pure (?).

** Volk Commentary p.180: notes that in the late version the verbal form is translated with hiaašu = 'hurry toward', which does not seem to be an accurate translation of the Sumerian verb. Note that again the interpretation of the line in the OB source is more difficult than the later version, and the translation offered here is extremely tentative.

BM 54707 resumes in  rev. 1'f. with lines that correspond to lines 16f. of the 1st mill. version of Tablet 21 and with lines from Ni 2412 rev. col. i

1': E = BM 54707 = CT 42, 48 (rev. 1'): [. . .] <x> <x> [. . .] = l.16?
LV 16: kuš₇ eŋ₃ hul-bi zi-ga me-e ši-in-ga-men₃-na
Akk. na-as-pa-an-tum ša₂ lem-niš te-bi-a-at ana-ku-[ma]

It is I who is destruction, a thing which rises wickedly.

** Commentary Volk p.215: cites literature for the reading of IŠ as kuš₇ = naspantu 'Niederwerfung' and 'destruction', including MSL XIII p.173 ii 2'. The term is also discussed in Sjoeberg JCS 21: 277.

2': E (rev. 2'): eŋir me₃-ka [. . .] = l.17 (etc.)
LV 17: eŋir me₃-ka us₂-sa-ŋu₁₀-ne
Akk. ina ar-ki ta-ha-zi ina re-di-<ya> 
H (= BM 85201) obv. 14: egir me₃-ka us₂-sa [. . .]

When I follow behind the battle,

3': E (rev. 3'): munus *da-*a te-a [. . .]
F (rev. col. i, 1'): munus <x> [. . .]
LV 18: nu-nus du-a te-a me-e ši-in-ga-men₃-na

H (BM 85201) obv. 15: nu-nus du-a te-a me-egloss: ba?-e men₃-[na]

It is I who is a woman who comes and goes.

** Commentary Volk p.216: cites IEb 28-29 for an instance in which the verb "te" 'to approach' seems to mean something more like 'attack', a connotation which would also fit this context well.

4': E (rev. 4'): e₂-*kaš-*a-*ka <*+tuš>-<*+a> [. . .]
F (rev. col. i, 2'): kaš? <x> [. . .]
F (rev. col. i, 3'): ga-<ša>-[an] [. . .]

Akk. a-šar₂ ši-ka-ri ina a-ša₂-bi-ya
H (BM 85201) obv. 16: e₂ kaš-a-ka tuš-<a>-ŋu₁₀

When I sit in the place where beer (is served),

5': E (rev. 5'): nu-nuz men₃ *šul *tar-*ra me-e ši-<*in> [. . .]
  Volk assumes that the scribe accidentally omitted a "ka" before "tar-ra"
F (rev. col. i, 4'): munusus2 [. . .]
LV 20: [nu]-<nus> men₃ šul kiri₄ zal me-e ši-in-ga-men₃-na

H (BM 85201) obv. 17: nu-nus men₃ šul kiri₄ zal-la me [. . .] <x> men₃ [. . .]

It is I who is a woman who is (like) a proud youth.

F (rev. col. i, 5'): <e₂> <{d}> [. . .]
This line is omitted in the late source

When I enter to the house of Mulil,

7': E (rev. 7'): nu-nuz kur-ra diri-ga me-e ši-in-<ga> [. . .]
This line is omitted in the late source

It is I who is a woman who is greater than a mountain.

Bottom edge of source E:
8': E (8'): *ki *di-da-ka gub-ba-ŋu₁₀-ne
LV 23: ki di-da-ka gub-ba-ŋu₁₀-ne
Akk. a-šar₂ di-nim ina u₂-zu-uz-zi-ya

It is I who is a woman who knows (how to judge) the case.

Akk. a-šar₂ ṣa-al-ti ina u₂-zu-uz-zi-ya
H obv. 18: ki du₁₄-da du₁₁ <x>-ba-ŋu₁₀ [. . .]

When I stand at the place of quarreling, 

(H 2, Kirugu 18) 20: munus i-bi₂ šu₂-šu₂ me-e ši-in-ga-men₃-na
11': E (11'): munus i-bi₂ šu₂-šu₂ me-e ši-in-ga-men₃-<na>

Akk. sin-niš-tum mu-da-a-tum pil-<tum> ana-ku-ma
H obv. 19: munus dim₃-ma til₃-la me-e men₃ [. . .]

LV: It is I who is a woman who knows insults.

** Commentary Volk p.218: the later "in zu", from in--dub₂ 'to insult' is easier to interpret than i-bi₂ šu₂-šu₂ in the earlier versions, which may be synonymous, but appears to be otherwise unattested. 

12': E (12'): ka₂ eš₂-<dam>-[ma-ka] [. . .]
  NOTE: this line and the following line are on the left edge of source E
LV 25: [ka₂]-<eš₂>-dam-ma-ka [tuš-a]-<ŋu₁₀>-ne
Akk. ina ba-ab aš-tam-mi ina a-ša₂-bi-ya 
H obv. 20: ka₂ eš₂-dam-ma-ka <x>-a-ŋu₁₀ [. . .]

When I reside at the door of the inn,

** Commentary Volk pp.219-220: cites other instances in which the kar-kid is associated with the eš₂-dam 'inn'.

(H 2, Kirugu 18) 18: munus lu₂ nu-zu me-e ši-in-ga-men₃-na
13': E (13'): kar-<<kid>> mu-<lu> [. . .]
LV 26: [kar]-kid mu-lu mu zu <me>-<e> [ši]-<in>-ga-men₃-[na]
Akk. ha-ri-im-tum ra-im-tum ana-<ku>-[ma]
H obv. 21: kar-kid mu-lu nu-zu me-e men₃ [. . .]

OB: It is I who is a woman who does not "know" men.
LV: It is I who is a prostitute who knows the penis of men.

** Commentary Volk pp.220-221: note that there seems to be a contradiction between the older and later versions of this line. Volk discusses a number of possibilities for interpreting the later version, but reading mu as ES for ŋiš₃ 'penis' seems to be the most likely, even if the Akkadian translation differs slightly from this meaning.

NOTE: the photo is difficult to read, but igi ba-an-da-šu₂ also seems possible (šu₂ instead of bar is certain)

Your ..., it is a ..., I who did not loosen it, covered your face with it(?)

9: [. . .] <x> ki a-la₂ durun(KU)-na-še₃ ninda nu-ku₂-e

There where she begins lamenting, she weeps hateful tears in her temple.

16: [a-a] <na> eŋ₃-de₅ a-a na eŋ₃-de₅ idim-e a-a na eŋ₃-de₅
NOTE: Kramer translates idim as "the watery-deep", assuming (reasonably) that the reference is to water in which Lisin's son has disappeared.

And the father offers advice, the father offers advice, the father offers advice concerning the spring. 

17: [a] ŋuruš a-a na eŋ₃-de₅ idim a-a na eŋ₃-de₅

Woe young man! The father offers advice, the father offers advice [concerning] the spring.

My lady, to the one who sails the boat, she speaks.

9: [lu₂ ŋišma₂] <diri>-ga i₃-u₅-na dumu-ŋu₁₀ ba-u₅ [. . .]
One who sails the boat, when you sail, my son is sailing ...

10: <kiri₄> nam-bi-ur₄-ur₄-ru-da al-lu₅ i₇-da-<gin₇>
PSD B: 153 reads al-lub and translates the term "crayfish" or "crab". The same entry cites Civil (JNES 32: 296) reading zu₂ nam-bi-ur₅-ru-da and translating "that my son not be crushed like a river crab/crawfish".

  Katz 2003: 18 translates "You who sail downstream do not hurt my son, you who sail downstream".

You who sail -- my son -- you who sail down stream, shall not hurt.

13: dumu {d}lisin(LI₉.SI₄)-ŋu₁₀ diri men₃ nam-ba-ab-si-si-ig-ge

My son, Lisin, you who sail downstream, shall not hurt.

14: nibru{ki}-a nam-mu-un-niŋin-ne u₄¬-da hu-mu-un-na-ab-<du₁₁> 

When you circulate around Nippur, you shall not speak about him during the day.

You shall not speak about him - ...

16: ambar-ra ša₃ kin-kin-ma-ni-ib dumu-ŋu₁₀ ba-ŋar <x> [. . .]

Search for him in the swamp, my son ...

17: i₇-da ša₃ su₃-ud ŋal₂-šu-mu-un-na-ab dumu-ŋu₁₀ <x> [. . .]

In the unfathomable depths of the river ..., my son ...

18: ama-gan-e LU₂xBAD mu-un-na-la₂-e dumu-ŋu₁₀ ba-an-ze₂-eŋ₃-men₃

The birth-giving mother shall raise the corpse for him, you shall give my son to her. 

19: za-ra lu₂-e en₃-ra tar-re za-e na-aŋ₂ mu-un-AK-e
Kramer considers the possibility that the verbal form at the end of the line should be read: na-aŋ₂-mu-un-AK-e, which would be translated "you should not do it".

One who inquires after you (will ask): what are you doing?

20: nam-usar-ra-ke₄ en₃-ra tar-re za-e na-aŋ₂ mu-un-AK-e

A neighbor inquiring after you (will ask): what are you doing?

21: a ur₅ a ama-za a ša₃ ama-za ša₃-ab hul til₃-la-zu
  Kramer Kraus Fs. p.144 this and the following two lines apparently duplicated by VAT 6077 (VS 10, 123) v 5-7 and BM 15822 (CT 42, 33) rev. 16-18.
VAT 6077 (collated) reads: a ur₅ ama-zu a ša₃ ama-zu / ša₃-ab hul til-la-za (contra Kramer, who reads til¬₃-la-za). The traces of the sign corresponding to"til/til₃" in BM 15822 are inconclusive, and could be either (or neither) -- though the sign seems to be too wide to be "til", and "til₃!" may be more likely. 

Woe, the liver of your mother! Woe, the heart of your mother, when your wicked heart is annihilated! 

22: [ŋuruš] ama-za na-me-ši-kar₂-ka u₃ nu-mu-un-ši-ku-ku
Since the parallel lines have mu-e-ši-kar-kar and me-ši-kar-kar respectively, the reading na-me igi-kar₂-ka(r) seems ruled out.
VAT 6077 reads: ŋuruš ama-zu mu-e-ši-kar-kar u₃ nu-mu-e-ši-ku-ku, which makes more sense, and can be translated: "Young man! Your mother is forsaken on account of you - she cannot sleep on account of you!"

Young man, your mother is restless on account of you - she cannot sleep because of you.

23: [ga]-<ša>-an-hur-saŋ-ŋa₂ na-me-ši-kar₂-ka u₃ nu-mu-un-<ku> / ku

Ninhursag is restless - she cannot sleep.

Copy and Edition: Thureau-Dangin, RA 19 (1922): 175-185.
Partial translations: Katz (2003), Images of the Netherworld, 101 and 205-210 Jacobsen (1980), Death in Mesopotamia, 19-24.


&&AO 3023 (RA 19: 175-185)
NOTE: the tablet is extremely well written and great care has been taken to make the signs clear. Plene writings are also avoided, though note the few instances in which the scribe occasionally writes a sign like "ma" inconsistently both plene and cursive, with the cursive sign occurring before the plene writings.

obv.
1: <*a> <šeš>? [. . .] 
NOTE: "a" is preserved, but nothing of the second sign remains on the tablet. Note also that this must be the first line on the tablet, because there is a 10-mark exactly nine lines after this one.

Woe, [my] brother ...

2: a šeš-ŋu₁₀ '' <ŋuruš>? [. . .]
  NOTE: the bottom wedge of the sign read as "ŋuruš" is preserved, but it is possible that this is another sign.

Woe, my brother, [my] <young man>? ...

3: a šeš-ŋu₁₀ '' <ŋuruš>?-<ŋu₁₀>? (OR: ama-zu?) ga-ša-an-<*mah>-<*ke₄>
  NOTE: all of the signs in this line are certain except for "ŋuruš-ŋu₁₀", where the ŋu₁₀ is especially uncertain (in the current state of preservation of the tablet). Another possibility would be <e₂>-<x>. In fact, compared to "ŋuruš" in line 5, it really does not look anything like "ŋuruš" at all, and maybe it is "ama" followed by another sign (which could be "zu", but it is difficult to determine this with certainty). Note also that the ke₄ at the end of the line is written slightly above and to the right, making it possible (but unlikely) that it belongs to the end of the previous line.

Woe, my brother, my young man of Ninmah!

4: a-našeš-ŋu₁₀ <i>-luu2-na-am-ba *ME.*ME.<*ME> i-lu *ME.*ME.*ME *i-*lu *du₃-*bi ME.ME.<ME> [. . .]
  Akkadian gloss: "I wail for". "a-na" is written as a small gloss on the left edge of the tablet to the direct left of "šeš". The gloss "u₂-na-am-ba" is written to the bottom right of "lu" and is much smaller than the other signs in the line. "u₂" is fairly certain. ME.ME.ME is certain all three times it occurs, though note that the third ME.ME.ME continues on to the right edge of the tablet and the tablet is broken after the last ME sign, making it possible that other signs followed.

Wailing and mourning(?) for my brother - the wailing and mourning(?) that has begun is wailing! 

5: i-lu ME.ME.ME '' [(x)] *šir₃ *na-<*aŋ₂>-*ŋuruš-*ba

Wailing and mourning(?) - they are the songs of youth!

6: i-lu ME.ME.ME '' <*mu>-*lu <hul>?-<*še₃> *ir₂-*ra
NOTE: "še₃" is reasonably certain, but the sign before it is not, and looks nothing like "hul", and more like "TE". If the sign is "hul" then it is very tightly squeezed, but "hul" is not impossible.

Wailing and mourning(?) - the one who laments bitterly(?),

7: *a *ib₂-<*ta>?-lu-lu *a *ib₂-*lu-*lu <*gub>-<*ba> *a *ib₂-*ta-*lu-*lu
NOTE: almost all of the signs are completely certain, but note the first "ta" does not look too much like the "ta" in the last form in the line, and "ta" is omitted all together in the second verb. Note also that it is possible that the sign is "ta" with a one to three sign gloss beneath it. In fact, it seems more and more like there is a small gloss here, and that the sign should be read as "ta".

She is flush with tears, she is flush with tears, the one standing there is flush with tears! 

8: *ŋuruš *ama-<*zu> '' a ib₂-*ta-lu-lu
NOTE: the sign read as "zu" is either "zu" or "ba", but "zu" is more likely.

Oh, young man, your mother is flush with tears! 

9: *ama-*zu <*ga>-<*ša>-<*an>-<hur>?-<saŋ>?-<ŋa₂>?-<*ke₄> *a *ib₂-*ta-*lu-*lu
NOTE: ga-ša-an and ke₄ are certain, but the signs in between are not, and it is possible that the first of these signs in "nin". But given that the mother of egi₂-me is identified as ga-ša-an-hur-saŋ-ŋa₂-ke₄ below, this reading is likely here as well. 

Your mother, Ninhursag, is flush with tears!

10: (*10-mark) munusegi(*ŠE₃)-*me <*e₂> mah?-*a *egi₂(ŠE₃)-<*ke₄>? a ib₂-ta-lu-lu
NOTE: e₂ is likely but not completely certain, and "mah" is less certain - if it is "mah" then it may be poorly written, or unusually wide. When compared to "mah" in the line below, however, the signs look different, but not completely different, so "mah" is definitely possible. Note also that the sign after "ŠE₃" is written very lightly, and while consistent with "ke₄" (in the next line), it may have been erased. The best reading of these signs may nonetheless be "e₂-mah-a egi₂-ke₄", though.

Egime, in the lofty house, the princess, is flush with tears!

11: a-tu-banda₃ *munuseme₅-*siki-*la₂!(ME)-*la₂!(ME)-ke₄ a ib₂-ta-lu-lu
For eme₅-siki in connection with Atubanda see AOAT 25: 340 with n.45).
NOTE: the horizontal wedges in the signs read as "la₂" are written near the top of the preceding vertical, and thus look more like "la₂" than "me". They are both also clearly the same sign.

Atubanda, the elderly mother (lit. "woman [who holds the office] of the mother with hanging hair"), is flush with tears!

12: *šeš-*ŋu₁₀ *ama-*zu a ib₂-<*ta>-lu-lu

My brother, your mother is flush with tears!

13: e₂-gal *keš₃*{ki}-*a-*ke₄ '' *a ib₂-ta-lu-lu

The palace of Kesh is flush with tears!

14: *še-*eb *uru₂-*SAR-*ka '' a ib₂-ta-lu-lu

The brick-work of the city(?) is flush with tears!

15: *e₂ *mah adab(*UD.*NUN){ki}-*a-*ke₄ '' *a *ib₂-ta-lu-lu

The lofty temple of Adab is flush with tears!

16: še-eb adabu(*UD.*NUN.*BU){ki}-*ke₄ '' a ib₂-ta-lu-lu

The brick-work of Adabu is flush with tears!

17: *du₅-*mu-*ŋu₁₀ lu-up-*ta-*{ki}-*i{d} *ma-*am₃ *ib₂-*gi₄ *im-*me
NOTE: the gloss is written below and to the right of "ŋu₁₀" and while "lu" and "up" are uncertain but possible, "ta-ki-id" are completely certain. NOTE: "ma" in this and the following lines looks more like "ma" than "ama", but "ama" is also possible.

"My son, when will you return?", she cries out.

18: du₅-*mu-*ŋu₁₀ *mu-lu-*LIL ma-am₃ ib₂-gi₄ im-me
NOTE: the sign read as "LIL" looks like "sukud" or "galam".

"My son, Lulil, when will you return?", she cries out.

19: *du₅-*mu *mu-*lu *ki-*aŋ₂-*ŋu₁₀ ma-am₃ ib₂-gi₄ im-me
NOTE: the scribe definitely omitted the second "MU" between the other two "MU" signs at the beginning of the line.

"Son, my beloved one, when will you return?", she cries out.

20: (10-mark) *egi₂-*e *šeš-*a-*ni '' *gu₃ *mu-*un-*na-*de₂-*e

The princess calls out to her brother:

21: *šeš-*ŋu₁₀ *ki-*nu₂-<*zu> *zi-*ga '' *ama-*zu *de¬₃-*ri-*ib₂-*la₂

"My brother, rise from your bed, may your mother hang over you (in grief)!"

22: ama-zu *ga-*ša-*an-*hur-*saŋ-*ŋa₂-*ke₄ ama-zu de₃-ri-ib₂-la₂

"May your mother, Ninhursag, your mother hang over you!"

27: {d}<*li₉>-*si₄ mu-lu *ur₅ *ša₃-*ba-*ke₄ *de₃-ri-ib₂-la₂

"May Lisin, the one who moans (in lament), hang over you 

28: [. . .] <x> <x> <zu> '' *de₃-*ib-*la₂
NOTE: In this and the following lines there are no longer any readable traces on the tablet in the first half of each line.

"May ... hang over your ..."

29: [. . .] <x> <x> '' *de₃-*ib₂-*la₂

"May ... hang over ..."

30: [. . .] <x> '' *de₃-*ib₂-*la₂

"May ... hang over ..."

31: [. . .] <x> <ga>?-<zu> '' *de₃-*ib₂-*la₂
NOTE: this last line is written between the bottom of the tablet and the top of the bottom edge.

"May ... hang over your ..."

Rev.
1 (32): *šu-*um-*du-*um *ku₇-*ku₇-*da-*zu '' *mu *de₃-*ib₂-*tuku
NOTE: the signs read as "ku₇-ku₇" are definitely not "du₇-du₇"

"May I hear your trembling lips!"

2 (33): *inim ze₂-ba-zu mu de₃-ib₂-tuku

"May I hear your sweet words!"

3 (34): abgal(NUN.*ME)? *sa₆-*ga-*zu '' *ša₃ *de₃-*ib₂-*dub-<*be₂!>?
NOTE: Jacobsen Mesopotamia 8: 24 n.4 very tentatively suggests reading "MUŠ₃-me" 'visage'? at the beginning. Either way, abgal seems out of place here. Looking at the tablet, the second sign is definitely "ME", but the first sign really does look more like "MUŠ₃" than "NUN", which seems very unlikely. Another possibility is that this sign is "UR", though the horizontal wedge at the beginning of the sign really does seem to be closer to the middle than the bottom of the sign. The second to last sign is UM with vertical wedges throughout it, followed by a sign that is definitely not "bi" and could be "nam" or another sign. "BI" is impossible, though.

"May your beautiful ... move me(?)!"

4 (35): *ŋuruš-*e ama-zu *ir₂-*ra *na-*aŋ₂-*bi₂-*ib₂-*tuš-*en
NOTE: tuš-en at the end of the line is completely certain.

"Young man, you should not make your mother sit in tears!"

5 (36): ama-zu ga-ša-an-*hur-*saŋ-*ŋa₂-*ke₄ *še *ša₄-*še₃ *na-*aŋ₂-*bi₂-*ib₂-*tuš-*en

"You should not make your mother, Ninhursag, sit moaning!"

6 (37): *munus*egi-*me na-aŋ₂-*ur₅-*ra-*zu na-aŋ₂-bi₂-ib₂-*tuš-*en

"You should not make Egime, the one who lacerates herself (in mourning) for you, sit (lamenting)!"

7 (38): *u₃-*a na-aŋ₂-bi₂-ib-*AK-*en *ki-*nu₂-*zu *zi-*ga

"You should not cause wailing - rise up from your bed!"

8 (39): mu-lu-*lil *u₃-*a na-aŋ₂-bi₂-ib-*AK-*en ki-nu₂-zu zi-ga

"You should not make Lulil wail - rise up from your bed!"

9 (40): (*10-mark) *šeš-*e *nin₉-*a-*ni *mu-*na-*ni-*ib-*gi₄-*gi₄
NOTE: for this and the remaining lines see also Katz, Images of the Netherworld, 205-206.

The brother replied to his sister:

10 (41): *šu *bar-*ŋu₁₀ *nin₉-*ŋu₁₀ *šu *bar-*ŋu₁₀

"Let me go, my sister, let me go!"

11 (42): munusegi-me šu bar-ŋu₁₀ nin₉ šu bar-ŋu₁₀

"Egime, let me go! Sister, let me go!"

12 (43): nin₉-e na-aŋ₂-*mu(-)*ub-*du₁₁-*du₁₁-*en *mu-*lu *i-*bi₂ *du₈ *nu-*me-*en
NOTE: "ub" is extremely likely here and in the next line (in fact it is certain) and du₁₁-du₁₁ in this line and the next are also completely certain.

"Sister, you should not reproach me, I am one whose eyes are no longer open!"

13 (44): munusegi-me na-aŋ₂-mu-ub-du₁₁-du₁₁-en mu-lu i-bi₂ *du₈ *nu-me-en

"Egime, you should not reproach me, I am one whose eyes are no longer open!"

14 (45): ama-ŋu₁₀ ga-ša-*an-*mah na-aŋ₂-*mu-*ub-du₁₁-du₁₁-*en mu-lu *i-*bi₂ du₈ *nu-*me-*en

"My mother, exalted lady, you should not reproach me, I am one whose eyes are no longer open!"

15 (46): ki-nu₂-*ŋu₁₀ *sahar kur-ra-ke₄ mu-lu *a *du₁₁-*ba *bi₂-*nu₂

"My bed is the dust of the netherworld - I lie among those who grumble!"

16 (47): *u₃-*sa₂-ŋu₁₀ *MUD-*e mu-lu *erim₂-*ba *bi₂-*tuš
NOTE: MUD = HU.HI

"My sleep is troubled - I reside with those who are wicked!"

17 (48): *nin₉-ŋu₁₀ *mu-*nu₂-*a-*ŋu₁₀ *nu-*mu-*zi-*ga-*ŋu₁₀

"My sister, I am one who cannot rise up from my bed!"

18 (49): ama-ŋu₁₀ *ŋa₂-*a *ma-*ab-*la₂-*da-*kam *si-*la-*ah *bi₂-*ib₂-*du₈
NOTE: for the idea that "si-la-ah" is an Elamite loan word for "statue" see Katz, Images, p.206 n.25.

"My mother, so that it is I who is hung (i.e. mourned) over - a statue has been fashioned."

19 (50): (10-mark) ga-ša-an-*hur-*saŋ-*ŋa₂-*ke₄ *ma-*a *ma-*ab-*la₂-*kam *si-*im-*la-*ah *bi₂-*ib₂-*du₈
NOTE the plene writings of both "ma" signs in this line (and throughout the remainder of the tablet, where in other places on the tablet (including the previous line) the sign is abbreviated (without the small top vertical wedge at the beginning of the sign).

"Ninhursag, so that it is I who is hung (i.e. mourned) over - a statue has been fashioned."

20 (51): nin₉-ŋu₁₀ *gub-*ba *e₂ *ad-*da-*ŋu₁₀ ha-la-ŋu₁₀ *ze₂-*eŋ₃-*ma-*ab

"Give my lot to my sister who tends to the house of my father."

21 (52): a-a-ŋu₁₀ a *de₃-*ma-*ab-*lu ha-la-ŋu₁₀ *he₂-*a

"Because it is my lot, may by father be flooded with tears over me."

22 (53): *ama-*ŋu₁₀ *siki *de₃-ma-ab-la₂ *TI-*ŋu₁₀ *he₂-*nu₂

"Because my life is dormant, may my mother hang down her hair (in mourning) for me."

23 (54): *e₂-*gi₄-*a *ad-da-ŋu₁₀ *še *de₃-*ma-*ab-*la₂-*e *mu-*da-*am₃(-)*ib₂-*tuku
NOTE: the reading of the end of the line is completely certain.

"... may my sister-in-law weigh out grain for my father."

24 (55): *mu-*nu₂ *šu *te-*ma-*abša-ar-šu i-{d}i-ip *tumu-*bi *ba-*bar *mu-*un-*AK
For this line see Attinger ZA 95 (2005): 219, who understands ba-bar--AK to mean "souffler au loin (en parlant d'un fantôme)", against Katz, PSD A/3, and CAD E 28, which translate: 'when you have called out my formula of release'. As in the other lines the gloss is written to the bottom right of "ab". ša-ar-šu i-di are all certain, but while the last sign could be "ib", a sign like "ṣi" seems more likely. 

"Fetch a bed and make its spirit blow over it".

25 (56): *aš-*te *gub-*i₃ *si-*la-*ah *tuš-*bi
NOTE: above the "bi" (and to the right) and below the "AK" in the previous line there seems to be another sign that may be "na", meant to serve as a gloss to "AK", and this "na" is almost completely certain.

"Set up a throne and place a statue on it"

26 (57): *TUG₂ aš-te *mar-*i₃ *si-*im-*la-*ah *dul-*bi
NOTE: TUG₂ is very likely, as it is definitely LAGAB with at least two, and probably only two horizontals.

"Place a cloth over the throne and cover it with a simlah."

27 (58): *ninda ki-*si₃-*ga *si₃-*bi *GUR-*bi *šu *te-*ma-*ab
CAD E 28: "cast thereon the bread cast on the ground (as sacrifice to the dead)"; Katz, Images, p.206 with n.29: "Place the bread offering and wipe it!". Note that Katz understand the verb here as "šu--gur" 'to wipe' and thing that "te" is a mistake. Note that the sign after the first si¬₃ only has two verticals inside it, while the sign after the second si₃ has three verticals inside it, as does the "bi" after "GUR". Note also that "šu te" is completely certain.
PSD A/2 translates this and the following line: "deposit the funerary offerings, bring their ... to me, pour water into the libation pipe, heap up the dust of the netherworld".

"Receive its offered and wiped kispu-bread."

28 (59): *a *a-*pa₄-*še₃ *bal-*bi *sahar *kur-*ra *de₂-*bi

"Pour the water that was channeled into the libation pipe into the dust of the netherworld."

29 (60): (*10-mark) *utul₂ *kum₂(NE)-*ma *bal-*bi *me-*lam₂-*bi *bi₂-*rig₇(PA.HUB₂.DU)

Make the hot soup that has been poured out glow with a fiery aura.

30 (61): *nin₉-*ŋu₁₀ *me-*li-*e-*a *me-*e *na-<*an>-<til₃>?
NOTE: "an" is likely, and "TI" is also possible, since the only wedge that is preserved is a Winkelhaken at the end of the last sign in the line, and there is exactly enough space for the rest of "TI" in the break between "an" and this wedge.

"My sister, in woe I cannot live(?)"

31 (62): munuš*egi-*me-<*e>? [. . .] <me>?-<li>?-*e-*a <x> [. . .]
NOTE: "me" and "li" are possible, but not certain and there is very little left of the sign after "a".

"Egime ... in woe ..."

32 (63): *ir₂-<*ra>? [. . .]

"Tears ..."

33 (64): <x>? [. . .]
NOTE: the bottom edge of the tablet begins here, and there appears to be at least one line that is completely broken. This line is followed by a line in which the first sign is partially preserved but difficult to read, but "nin₉" followed by "<x>" is possible. The same line with this sign has some signs preserved in the middle that look like <šu> <nu>-<bar> <KE₄/LIL₂> nu [. . .]

Then this line is followed by another line that is broken at the beginning and end, but seems to have traces of exactly the same signs in the middle of the line:

Aruru Laments:

1) BM 96681 (CT 36, pl.47-50), photo in RA 65, edition in Gratz College, Anniversary Volume (both Kramer). Copy in CT 36; photo by Gabbay. 4-column tablet (2 per side) with a line count and date formulae at the end of the tablet, dating text to Rim-Suen Year 9. Lament to Aruru with dividing lines between sections. Note also that the copy in CT 36 leaves numerous lines and signs that are visible on the photograph uncopied, particularly on the obverse. A complete reconstruction is not attempted here. Signs not visible on copy in CT 36 follow Kramer's transliteration in the Gratz College Anniversary Volume.

Kramer translates: "An, her father, decrees the fate", but with "-na" this is grammatically unlikely, and there does not appear to be a preceding referent to make this an anticipatory genitive.

An determine a fate for his "fathers".

NOTE: Kramer does not note the presence of a double-dividing line here, and given the parallels between the next line and the similar pair of lines earlier in this section, it is possible that he is correct. But note, however, that Kramer does not note the presence of any dividing lines on the tablet, so this might not mean anything.

NOTE: it is possible that the sign read as "ad" is "eŋ₃" and that the sign following it is "la", or a sign that looks like "a", since the sign looks more like "la" than "ba".

** Dingir-Mah/Aruru Ershemma + Nin-nigara Lament
The Ershemma to Dingir-Mah and Aruru is preserved in nearly identical form (with some important differences) in L.1501 (ISET 1, p.227)and O.17 (Limet, Akkadica 2000: 3-7 -- but since Limet's transliteration has numerous errors, the photograph of the tablet by Gabbay was used to improve the transliteration whenever possible), both of which are identified in their colophons as Ershemmas. Most, but not all, of the Ershemma in these two sources is duplicated in the first section of BM 96936 (CT 58, 20), a six-column tablet containing the final Kirugus of a Balag to Nin-nigara. Note, however, that the first two lines of BM 96936, and the last line of the first section, are different from the first two lines and the last lines of L.1501 and O.17, indicating that these sources contain a "different" text than the first section of BM 96936. The Ershemma is translated first, using the first section of BM 96936 as the main source, and then followed by the rest of BM 96936.

Here are some comments about the text I sent to Uri Gabbay:
The content of BM 96936 is really interesting, but I'm still having a hard time sorting out how it all fits together. Clearly the text involves Inana getting pregnant, possibly by Enlil, and giving birth to Pabilsag, who is the husband of Ninisina/Gula, who may be the goddess lamenting at the beginning and throughout the text that she does not have a family. After the child is born Enlil blesses him and takes him into his own household so that his sister and brother won't have to take care of him. The real question for me (and this might be completely obvious and I am just missing it...) is how Ga-sha-an-nigin3-gar-ra fits into all this. In the litany at the beginning the name seems to refer to Ninisina/Gula (because it occurs along with the other standard deities mentioned in Ninisina/Gula litanies), but later in the same section, ga-ša-an-niŋin₃-ŋar-ra seems to be the deity who is being lamented to, and appears to be either another name for Inana, or for another "mother-goddess" corresponding to Aruru/Dingir-mah, the deity who occupies the same role in the Ershemma in O.17, L.1501, and VAT 3606 that duplicates the first section of this text. So if ga-ša-an-niŋin₃-ŋar-ra is not Inana, and is instead another deity who is lamenting about not having a family, which deity gets pregnant - is it Inana or this deity? And since the text includes a line in which Inana is being accused of acting like a woman who is only worth 30 shekels, it would seem like it is she who had the child, and that the child is illegitimate, suggesting that the solution could have been to give Pabilsag to the lamenting goddess, but this is all highly uncertain. Also, the occurrence of the "ancestors of Enlil" litany in rev. col. vi is extremely interesting, but since the section before it is broken, it is not clear how it fits into the text.  

Obv. 
col. i
1: ma? niŋin₃-ŋar-ra-ka ki-a <mu>-<ni>-ib-be₂
  L.1501 obv. 1: tumušen a-še-er su tumušen!(RI) a-še-er-<gin₇>
  = catalogues B₂, B₃, and B₄ = tumušen a-še-er su₃ = Cohen No. 96.
NOTE: the photo on the BM website is too small to make out too many details, but the first sign in the line, and the corresponding sign in the next line, looks more like "ma" than "e₂" or "erim₃", but the reading of the sign is still uncertain. In support of "ma", compare SBH 31: 19 e₂ niŋin₃-mar-ra (see Krecher SKL 128f. for an extended discussion of this deity and her name).
  O. 17 obv. 1: [tumušen a]-ši-ir *su(OR: zu?) tu-<*um>-<*ma>? <*di> [(x) (x)]
NOTE: the signs after "tu" are difficult to make out from the photo, but the sign after "TU" is definitely either "um" or "ra" and the sign following that is either "ma" or possibly (but less likely) "di". If the signs are read tu-um-ma-sa₂(OR: ši) [. . .] this could be taken as a phonetic writing for "tumušen a-[še-er-gin₇]", but this is epigraphically difficult. It is also very difficult to determine whether there are one or two horizontal wedges in the sign read as "su" in this line and the next, so it is possible that the sign is either "su" or "zu"; given the writing "su₃" in the catalogues, however, "su" seems more likely. O.17 is Lament no. 3 to Aruru in Black's catalogue of Aruru laments in the Klein Fs.
  O. 17 obv. 2: [ga-ša-an]? {d}a-ru-ru a-ši-ir su?
NOTE: given the probability that "ra" is written after "tu" in O.17, it is possible that the "re" in L.1501 is not a mistake for "mušen", but instead that the form is meant to be read "tu-re" 'sick one', instead of as tumušen.
NOTE: the e₂-niŋin₃-ŋar-ra usually refers to one of Inana's temples in Zabalam, Akkad, or Shuruppak.

At the Nigingara-house, she calls out at that place.
L.1501: The dove, in extended lamenting, the dove, like one lamenting (OR: like a sick person lamenting).

2: mu-gig gi?-DIŠ? ma? niŋin₃-ŋar-ra-ka / ki-a mu-ni-ib-be₂
NOTE: -ke₄ cannot be ruled out at the end of the first part of the line, but the top and bottom wedges at the head of the sign seem to be diagonal and not vertical wedges, unlike the clear "ke₄" at the end of the next line.
L.1501: omits

O. 17 obv. 4: [. . .] *nin *ama *kur-*kur men₃
NOTE: according to Krecher's commentary to Enanun in SKL p.126, Enanun is sometimes equated directly with Ninisina, and both are identified as the wife of Pabilsag, who play a role later in this text. Krecher reads the epithet as gu₃-an-ne₂-si = "one whose voice fills the heaven", but the writing kur-kur in O.17 makes it clear that the reading "kurku₂" is intended.

Enanun, mother of the floodwave.

  NOTE: "si" instead of "šu" is possible, but it is difficult to determine from the photo.

O.17 obv. 10: šu gal-gal *kin(OR: ur₄) *ši *gi₄-*gi₄-*de₃
  NOTE: the sign read as "kin" in BM 96936 seems to have too many wedges to be "tuku", but the corresponding sign in O.17 is either "tuku" or a simplified form of "kin", and since the copy of L.1501 has a sign that also looks more complex than "tuku" and closer to "kin", it may be better to assume that "kin" was intended here. 

To have the ones with large hands perform manual work(?)

11: šu zi-da-*ŋa₂ *gana₂? *bil₂-*la₂-*e-<*de₃>
NOTE: The sign read as "gana₂" is almost certainly not "ki" or "šu", and since the bottom horizontal wedge is longer the top horizontal wedges and both wedges seem to angle down at an angle, "gana₂" is not unlikely. Note also that the following sign is either NE or NExPAP, and this may be a phonetic writing of "bala".
L.1501 obv. 10: šu zi-da-ŋu₁₀ gana₂!(copy has "ki") bala-e-de₃-[en] 
O.17 obv. 11: šu zi-da-ŋu₁₀(over an erased sign) *gana₂ bala-e-*de₃
NOTE: the sign on the tablet is definitely KAR₂ or GANA₂, and it is unlikely that this sign is a poorly written "ki".
VAT 3606 obv. 1': [. . .] <bala>? [. . .]
  NOTE: the surface of the obverse of VAT 3606 is very worn, making it very difficult to read in places.

O.17 12: gub₃-bu-ŋu₁₀ nam-*šul! *di-*di-*de₃
NOTE: the sign read as ŠUL appears on the tablet as a sign that looks more like AŠ.NIG₂ or BUR
VAT 3606 obv. 2': [. . .] ŋu₁₀ <*nam>-<*šul> [gi₄]?-<gi₄>? [. . .]
  Compare IEb 56: utug₂-saŋ-7-e zi-da-na nam-šul ba-ni-in-AK, which PSD A/3 114 translates: "the seven-headed mace at her right side showed its youthful strength".

To make those on my left side act vigorously.

13: ul peš!-peš! *ama-*bi *i₃-gi₄-gi₄-de₃
NOTE: the second and third signs on the tablet do not really look like "peš", but it is unclear what other signs they would be. Note also that it is possible that the sign read as "i₃" is "ir" -- the inside of the sign is too worn to see how many vertical wedges were inside it.
L.1501 obv. 12: ul peš!(HA)-peš <x> ama-bi i₃-gi₄-gi₄-<de₃>-[en] 
VAT 3606 obv. 3': <*ul> *peš(GIR)-<*peš> *ama-*bi *i₃-<gi₄>? [. . .]
O.17 13: ul *pe-*pe-*eš *mah-*bi *si?(OR: KU?) *gi-*ir-*gi-*re
NOTE: šu is extremely unlikely, but it is possible that the sign read as "si" is LAGAB or LAGABxU.
  O.17 14: ul pe-pe *pa-<*edin>? *pa(-)*ŠI-*da-še₃(OR: šu?)

To make their mother flush with joy.(?)

VAT 3606 obv. 4': *ama-*ŋu₁₀ *e₂ *ma-*an-<ku₄>? <te>-*a-*am₃ [. . .]
  NOTE: the sign read as "ku₄" is definitely not "du" or "du₃", but it is not entirely certain that it is "ku₄" either.
O.17 17: *ama-*ŋu₁₀ *a *ma-*du *da-*a-*a *dam *ma-*du *da-*a-*a
  NOTE: it is difficult to determine from the photo whether the sign before "a-a" in the forms in this and the following lines is "ma" or "da" -- if the latter, this could be understood as a phonetic writing of "ta", which would be parallel to ta-e-am₃ "what?", in the other sources. Although ma-a-a "whereto?" is well attested, it typically requires a verb of motion, which does not seem to be present here.
CT 58, p.14 translates this line: "My mother, you have built a house for me, but what does it mean, you have given me a husband, but what does it mean?".

My mother built a house for me - what (has become of it)?; she gave a spouse to me - what (has become of it)?

  NOTE: it is possible that the sign after "ki" is "sikil", but the wedges after "MI₂" are not completely consistent with the end of "sikil" and may belong to another sign.

O.17 21: e₂-bi 30-kam(-)*ma(-)*DU(-)DU(-)da-ka mu <x> [. . .]
NOTE: another possibility (suggested to me by Uri Gabbay) would be to read "e₂-bi eš-ub-aš ku?-du du-da" and interpret this as a phonetic writing of "e₂-bi e₂ šu-peš ki-da du₃-a", which is certainly a possibility. The only difficulty with this interpretation is that the sign read as "ub" has a Winkelhaken or a diagonal wedge inside it, which is rare for UB in this period (which usually has a single vertical wedge inside it), and more typical of "kam"; and more problematically the sign following is almost certainly "ma" and not "AŠ.KU" (compare, for example "ma" in obv. 18 of this source, which is identical in form to this sign, and includes the small horizontal wedge that looks like a truncated AŠ at the beginning of the sign). Assuming that this line is written phonetically, however, another possibility might be to read "e₂-be₂-eš-ub!" as a phonetic writing of "e₂-bi e₂ šu-peš" with a verbal form "ma-DU.DU" following it.

NOTE: in all the sources that have it, it is really difficult to determine whether the sign after "ni₂" is "zu" or "ba", and it is quite possible that "ba" is a better reading than "zu".

Following CT 58, p.14, this line can be translated: "Mother, mistress, you yourself acted like a woman worth 30 shekels of silver".

  NOTE: the sign after the sign read as "sig" is definitely "ga" and not "bi", and the sign read as "eŋ₃" looks a lot more like "eŋ₃" than "ad", and "sig", while far from certain, is more likely than "gal".
  NOTE: O.17 continues with 5 more lines that are different than the last line in this section of BM 96936, and L.1501 continues with 3 more lines that are different than the line in BM 96936. The first two of these lines in L.1501 are identical to the first two of these lines in O.17, but the last line of L.1501 is different than all three of the last lines of O.17.

5: al-di-di-in ama dingir-re al-di-di-in
  NOTE: the verb al-di-di 'to wander around' occurs frequently in the laments to describe goddesses wandering around in despair. In the Inana Balags preserved in BM 96880 and BM 96933 there is a later Kirugu in both sources that begins with a sequence of similar lines, but with Inana as the goddess instead of Nin-Nigingara. The verb is also attested with Ninisina in similar contexts.

NOTE: in the second part of the line the copy has a clear za₃-da u₄-da, and while this is not inconsistent with what can be read from the photo, "za₃" is not completely certain in this line or the next two lines. In her dissertation, Karahashi lists two za₃ compound verbs, and these are za₃--keš₂ and za₃--tag, neither of which take -da-. Note, however, that the Gula Ershemma BM 15793 col. ii 11 has the verb za₃-da ba-da-an-DU, which Cohen 1981: 101 translates "it is right next to me". A similar verb also occurs in the Damu lament BM 88858.

At that time, the one who ... shining things ... at the side(?) ...

7': *u₃-*mu-*un-<e>? *e₂-*an-*na [. . .] / <za₃>?-<da> ba-<da>-an [. . .]
NOTE: the sign read as "e" looks too wide to be "e", but it clearly consists of a top and bottom horizontal wedge with a vertical wedge at the end of the sign, like "ama", "e₂", "ke₄", etc., but since the inside of the sign is worn, it is not possible to determine which sign this is.

The lord ... the Eanna ... at the side(?) ...

8': u₃-mu-un-<*bi>? <ga>?-*ra *za-gin₃-<*na> / <za₃>?-*da ba-da-an-<DU>?
NOTE: the copy has a sign that looks like "TU" at the end of the line, but on the photo the presence of "TU" is much less clear, and it is possible that another sign was intended here. In light of the occurrences of a similar verbal form with "gub" (see note to 6'), "DU" might be a better possibility, but the traces on the photo are also not completely consistent with DU either (there appear to be two small vertical wedges on top of one another at the end of the sign, for example).

Its lord ... lapis, placed at his(?) side(?).

10': <*du₅>-mu-ŋu₁₀-ra <e₂> he₂-en-na-ŋa₂-ŋa₂ / <nir> he₂-en-na-us₂-e
NOTE: the copy has a clear "ŋuruš" at the beginning of the second part of this line and the next, but this sign is no longer at all clear on the tablet, and it is possible that another sign was written here -- it is clear from the traces, however, that this sign is the same sign as the corresponding sign in the next line -- "e₂" is an uncertain possibility. The first sign in the line is definitely not "e₂", as it is copied, but is almost certainly the same sign that begins the next line (du₅).
CT 58 p.14 understands this line to refer to Enlil speaking about giving the child he fathered with Nin-Nigingara a house.

"For my son, I want to establish a house for him, to have him acquire fine things(?)

11': du₅-mu-ŋu₁₀-ra <*e₂> ta-aš al-ŋa₂-ŋa₂ / <x> ta-aš al-us₂-e

"For my son, why is a house being established? Why is he acquiring fine things?(?) 

12': niŋin₃-ŋar-ra usar-ra dumu-ni-ta / ta-aš ma-ni-ib-ku₄-ku₄
CT 58 pp.14-15: "Why do they bring the child into the neighboring storehouse for me?"

18': e₂ me-bi? du₅-mu-u₃ ga-ra-an-du₁₁

NOTE: the second half of this line is very uncertain, which is unfortunate, since it is the key to understanding the end of the text. The copy reads "unu₂ suba-a a ša₃-ba-ni", but the signs copied as "A" lacks the double vertical wedge at the end of the sign and could be "MIN", the sign copied as "ša₃" could be "gana₂" or a sign other than "ša₃", and it is unclear whether the sign at the end of the line has one, two, or three verticals inside it, or whether the sign preceding it is "ma" or "ba". Following the copy, the last line could be translated: "(on account of) the suba-ornament, woe is her heart", or following my tentative transliteration: "suba ornaments DITTO DITTO she planted fields for me", which is also unsatisfying.

NOTE: this line and the following lines, and possibly also the preceding line, contain a version of the standard Ninisina litany cited by Gabbay in HES 1: 51, but note that the epithets here occur in a different sequence, and in this litany Ninisina is usually identified as "sa₁₂-du₅ an-na", but the traces of the sign before "ga" here definitely do not belong to "na", and almost certainly belong to "mah". If this is the case, then it is probable that this is a variant to the more common epithet of Ninisina, sa₁₂-du₅ an-na, which is to be read sa₁₂-du₅ mah, cited by Krecher SKL 120 as occuring here and in three other sources.

NOTE: the expected epithet here would be: dumu e₂-a ga-ša-an gu-nu-ra men₃, so it is likely that the scribe accidently put "men₃" before instead of after gu-nu-ra.

Son of the house, lady Gunura, I am.

8': ga-ša-an-niŋin₃-ŋar-ra ki ku₃-ga men₃

Nin-nigingara of the pure place, I am.

NOTE: for this line and the sequence of instruments that occur in the preceding lines, see Gabbay HES 1: 152, where he translates this line: "My gi-di(d) which does not moan!", and argues that gi-di(d) is a type of flute.

My <<house>> where the flute does not sound out.

22': mu-gu₃!-di-de₃ nu-mu-un-ta-ba-e-ŋu₁₀
  NOTE for mu-gu₃-di-de₃, see Gabbay HES 1: 117, where he argues that the term refers to any instrument with a soundbox. He also discusses this line and the occurrence of a similar line in SBH 14: 29, which contains the 1st millennium version of am-e bara₂-an-na-ra, in ZA 104 (2014): 164-65.

Uncertain - but probably Enlil Lament

&&BM 72884 = ES lament - probably addressed to Enlil, but possibly Dumuzi; BM website lists this as Sumerian literary with no date. The middle of a single column tablet with a composition that is definitely an Emesal lament.

Text No. 1: Enlil Lament

&&HS 1431 (TUM 4, 84) + HS 2722 (TUM in press): small, one-column tablet, missing the first two or three lines of the obverse and the end of the obverse. On the reverse the scribe seems to have stopped writing before finishing the copy. The tablet is not ruled or carefully spaced, and is reminiscent of the so-called "hymnic archive" tablets. Although Enlil occurs frequently in the text, the references to the galla-demons and to the cattlepen and sheepfold indicate that Dumuzi may also be alluded to in the text. Collated and photographed in Jena. The best photos of this tablet are the black-white photos given to me by Kai, which do not contain the new piece.

obv. 
*maximum of 1-2 lines broken
1': [x x (x) (x)] <x> [. . .]
NOTE: kur, ul, and bi are all possibilities for the partially preserved sign.
... 

2': [x x (x) (x)] *i-*lu-*bi [. . .]

... its wailing ...

3': [x x (x)] <x> <ama>? <*ga>-<*ša> [. . .] <*še₃>? 
NOTE: maybe this line should be read: [mu]-<gi₁₇>-ib ga-ša-[an] etc. 
Photo: <mu>-un bar u₃? <x> [. . .]
Copy: <mu>-un ga-<ša>? [. . .]
Collation June 2016: [x x (x)] <*mu/gi₁₇>-*ib/ama *ga-<*ša> [. . .]
  -- the first preserved sign is either "mu" of "gi₁₇" and the next sign looks much more like "ama" or "ib" (or "da") than "un", which can probably be completely ruled out, and looking at the sign again "ama" seems the most probable. "ga" is completely certain, and "ša" is almost completely certain as well.
 -- the broken sign at the end of the line, which is written on the tablet edge, seems to be the end of a box-like sign, like "še₃", and although there is a very small break after this sign, it is likely that this is the last sign in the line.

Mistress, Inana ...

4': [x x (x)] *ma(-)*KU *ku₃ *KU <*nam> [. . .] <x> 
NOTE: it is also possible that the two signs read as "KU" are "ba". The last, partially preserved sign in the line, has a long, bottom horizontal wedge, making it unlikely that this sign is "am₃", as in the following lines.

... pure ...

5': [a a {d}]<*mu>-*ul-*lil₂ <*ba>-<*e>-<*a>-<*gu>?-<*la>-am₃
NOTE: I've noted that the signs after Mulil are probably identical to the corresponding signs in the next line. The form at the end of the line is clearly identical to the form at the end of the next line, and in both forms, the broken sign before "la" has one long horizontal wedge, ends with two Winkelhaken, and seems to have a diagonal wedge above and below the horizontal near the beginning of the sign. "e" in both instances is completely certain.

... Enlil ...

6': [x x (x)] <x> *{d}*mu-ul-lil₂ *ba-*e-*a-<gu>?-la-am₃

... Enlil ...

7': [x x (x)] <x> da-bi a-na ba-<e>-bi/ga-ga
Following the copy. 
My collation notes read: [. . .] <x> <KA>-<bi> <<blank space>> ba-ba(-)bi/ga-ga
Photo: <x>-da-bi a-na-ba ba-ga-ga
Collation June 2016: [x x (x)] <x> <*da/ama>-*bi '' *a-*na(-)*ba-<*ba>-<*ga/ba>-*ga
NOTE: since there seems to be traces of two vertical wedges at the beginning of the second to last sign in the line, it seems more likely that the sign is "ga" instead of "bi" - note, however, that the last sign in the line looks different than this sign and has one vertical wedge that cuts through the middle of the "BI" that makes up the frame of the sign, a little like "gu₄", though the sign is probably "ga".

...

8': [x x x x] <*niŋ₂/bar>?-*bi-<*ta>? <*ga>-<*ša>-<*an>-*an-*na-<*ke₄> <silig/uru₂>? *ba-*an-URUxGU?(OR: RU.GU.A)
NOTE: "ta" is very probable, though "ama" is another (less likely) possibility. The following ga-ša-an-an-an-ke₄, however, is completely certain. The sign after "ke₄" seems to have too many wedges to be "uru₂", though "URUxGU" seems unlikely as well. The sign/signs after "ba-an-" are also difficult - though the Gestalt of the first sign is consistent with "RU", followed by either "GU.A" or "TE.A" as a ligature. URUxGU-a cannot be ruled out completely, though.

...

9': [x x(x)] <*mu>-*ul-*lil₂ <*mu>-<*lu> *li-*bi₂-*in-*du₁₁-*ga-*gin₇ 
NOTE: it is very probable that the mostly broken signs after "lil₂" are "mu-lu" followed by "li". The only other conceivable (though also plausible) possibility would be to read "le" instead of "mu-lu", which is also consistent with the traces between "lil₂" and "li".

... Enlil, like one who does not speak.


10': [x x] <x> <šu>? *hul *ba-*ni-*in-*AK
NOTE: the traces of the sign before "hul" are consistent with "šu", though a sign like "ŋa₂" is also conceivable.

... He ... wickedly ...

11': <*A>?.<*BI/ŠI>? [x (x)] <ni/ir> <*še> <*nu>?-*mu-*un-*ša₄ *i-*si-*iš-<*bi>? <*ba>?-*an-<še₈>?
NOTE: the new fragment, HS 2722, contains the beginnings of this and the following lines. 
Collation June 2016: It is more likely that the broken sign after "a" at the beginning of the line is "bi" than "ši", but it is also possible that this is another sign entirely. It is possible that the sign after "iš" is "nu" followed by "<ga>", but "bi" seem more probable. Another possibility would be to read "AŠ <ga>". The "an" after the sign read as "ba"? is completely certain. Neither "še" not "nu" is completely certain. "še₈" is far from certain, but it is almost impossible that the traces belong to "la₂-la₂" (the verb that is most frequently attested with "i-si-iš".

... he did not set ... moaning ...

12': *ŋa₂-<*bi> [x] <mu>? *{d}*ŠE.*TIR *nu-*un [. . .]
NOTE: it is not entirely possible that the top horizontal wedge of the sign after "ŋa₂" belongs to the bottom of a sign in the previous line, making it possible (though far from certain) that this sign is "nun". Given the pattern with "-bi" following the first sign in the next few lines, however, "bi" seems more likely.

... Ašnan did not ...

13': *tur₃-<*bi> *ba-*an-*gul *ab₂ <*mu>-*un-<*di> [. . .]
NOTE: all of these signs are completely certain, with the possible exception, that after "ab₂" there might be a small broken sign, like "nu".

That cattle-pen, he destroyed ... 

14': *amaš-<*bi> *u₈ *e-<*ze₂>? [. . .] <x>? [. . .]

That sheepfold, the ewe, the sheep ...

15': *e₂? <*gal>? <*A>? [. . .] <x> <x> <x> *ma(OR: <dam>) *ba [. . .]
NOTE: it is possible that the sign read as "e₂" is "ŋiš" (or less likely, ŋuruš) (and the same holds true for the first sign in the next line), and if the sign read as "A" after "gal" belongs to the sign read as "gal" then it is possible that both of these signs belong to a single sign like "UN". It is also possible that in the break before the sign read as "ma" the were wedges that belonged to the sign, making it possible that this sign is <dam> instead of "ma" (the same applies to the next line as well). Though given the clear "ma" in the next line, "ma" is probably more likely.

...

16': *e₂?-<gin₇>? <x> [(x) (x)] *ki *di-*ku₅-*ru-<*še₃>? <*ma> '' <x> [. . .]

... the place of judgement ...

17': *KA-*inim-*ma-*bi *si *nu-<*mu>-*un-*sa₂ [. . .]

He did not put in order its incantations ...

18': *TE-<bi>? *dim₃-*mi-*ir *šum₂-*mu *gu₄ *šu? *ZA? *MUŠ₃?-*ra-*NE [. . .]
NOTE: it is possible that the sign read as "ME" is "LA₂", which would necessitate interpreting the first word in the line as gal₅-la₂. In light of the clear ŋišgu-za at the beginning of the next line, however, temen may be a better reading. 
Collation June 2016: Another possibility would be to read a squeezed "bi" after "TE" instead of "me" or "la₂", which seems far more probable than "la₂". Looking at the tablet again, "ra" and "NE", but "šu" "za" and "MUŠ₃" far less so. The sign read as "šu" could be "ki" or even "KA" if the sign read as "za" belongs to the same sign. Also, "za" seems extremely unlikely, though "me" is possible, and the sign read as "MUŠ₃" could be "AK" or "lu", or another sign entirely.

The throne?, the god, giving ... 

19': *ŋiš*gu-<za>-*na in-šub *sahar-*ra *ba-*an-*da-*tuš
NOTE: the verbal form sahar-ra ba-an-da-tuš occurs in a few places, including GEN 253 and LSUr 410 - it is clearly a gesture of mourning and extreme sorrow, but the significance of -an-da- in this verbal form is unclear. Michalowski cites this form in his article on ergativity (JCS 32, 1980, 95), but is at a loss to explain the element /n/ in the form. 

He fell from his throne, he sat in the dust.

20': EZEN? <NE>? *dim₃-*mi-*ir-<*re>-*e-*ne-*ka *RU *im-*ma-*la₂-*la₂
NOTE: it is not impossible that the first sign in the line is "eš₃", but the sign seems to be a bit wider, like "EZEN", or even "banšur", which is followed by another wide sign like "NE".

He suspended ... among the shrine? ... of the gods.

21': *unu₂(TE!.UNUG) *kin-*sig₇-*bi *ki-*in-*dar *ba-<*an>?-*tar
NOTE: kin-sig₁₇ occurs frequently in connection with unu₂ gal, but I wasn't able to find a context in which it occurs with a similar verb. The phrase ki-in-dar mu-da-ab-tar occurs in Proverbs 3.7 in a different context. Alster's commentary (vol. ii, p.177) cites VAT 6077 (VS 10, 123) iii 12. for an occurence of the same verb with a type of milk being poured down/diverted into the cracks. The phrase also occurs in CT 58, 7: 40.
Collation June 2016: TE.UNUG is clear, but there are absolutely no traces of a "gal" before "kin" and the sign after "sig₇" is definitely "bi" and not "ga". Note also that is possible that the broken sign before "tar" is "da", but "an" seems just as likely.

The great dining hall of the afternoon meal has been diverted into the cracks(?)

22': *gal(OR: me?)-<*zu> <*na>? *saŋ *a-<*tu₅>-<*gin₇>? *siki *ba-*an-*da-*bur₂-*bur₂ 
NOTE: the verb bur₂ "to loosen", occurs with MUŠ₃, often together with the verb dub-dub, refering to undoing the hair in a gesture of mourning. Something similar may be intended here, but I couldn't find any occurrences of the verb with siki = hair. 
NOTE also that this is the last line preserved in the new fragment (HS 2722) - the rest is from the main tablet HS 1431 (TUM 4, 84).
Collation June 2016: it is possible that the sign read as "gal" is "me", but "gal" is more likely, and the traces of the next sign are consistent with "zu" (though "ba" is certainly also possible). The sign following that could be "na" or "ba", but this is far from certain. Instead of "gin₇", "ba" and "zu" are other possibilities. Looking at the tablet again, "ku₃" is also not impossible.

... the head ... he undoes the hair.

NOTE: the sign read as "lu" has at least two horizontal wedges inside "LAGAB" and can thus not be "KU".

11': *i-<*bi₂> [x x (x)] *šu *gaba-*a *AŠ *i₃-<*DU> [. . .] <*kam/te>?
NOTE: at the end of this line and the following line, on the edge of the tablet, there are traces of a sign that looks like either "te" or "kam", which, in each case is the last sign in the line. Before this sign in the following line (12'), there are also traces of another sign.

*beginning of column broken (but it is unlikely that more than two or three lines are missing, and it is also possible that no lines are missing at the beginning of this column and the next column)
1': <*uru₂>? [. . .]
NOTE: "uru₂" is possible, but since only two very faint wedges are preserved at the bottom of the sign, this is difficult to determine with certainty - the traces of the sign are much more consistent with "uru₂" than with "dam" though.
  CBS 497 + VAT 1334 + ... obv ii. 1: dam-ga-ra ba-da-[kur₂ du₃-a ka-na-aŋ₂-ŋa₂ al-lu₃ //

  NOTE: this and the next two lines do not have any parallels in any of the other sources with a temple litany similar to the one that begins in l.4'.
Possibly parallel, though, with "Enlil the Merchant" (UG n+1): dam-gar₃ ba-da-kur₂ du₃-a ka-naŋ-ŋa₂ al-lu₃

The merchant turned away, the entire land is confused.

3': *še-*eb *e₂-*kur-[*ra] *ki [. . .]
NOTE: there is only space in the break after "kur" for one sign, and it is thus unlikely that both "ra" and "ta" were written here.
  N 4210 obv. 4': še-eb e₂-kur-ra-<bi/ta>? [. . .]
Note the temple sequence in BM 29623 (CT 15, pl.12-13), 11-20: še-eb e¬₂-kur, ki-ur₃ ki gal, du₆-ku₆ ki ku₃, ša₃ e₂-dim₂-ma, e₂ ka₂ mah, e₂ ŋa₂-nun mah, ma-mu-šu₂-a, ma e₂-gal mah, še-eb urim, še-eb larsa, etc. This and similar temple litanies are discussed in SKL 80f.
EM 3: še-eb e₂-kur-ra-ta ki-ur₃ e₂ nam-til₃-la

From the brickwork of the Ekur, the Kiur, the house of life

The brickwork of the Ekur ...

4': <e>-*lum-e e₂ <*ka₂>? [. . .]
  NOTE: the last preserved sign looks more like "ka₂" than "gal", and it begins the same way as the preceding "e₂" (cf. "gal" in next line, which is simpler and looks completely different - so "gal" can be ruled out completely)
  N 4210 obv. 9': *e-*lum-*e *e₂ [. . .]

The honored one, the palace ...

5': *ma-*mu-*šu₂-*a-*ta *ma *e₂-*gal <*mah> [. . .]
  NOTE: the sign after "mu" is written very close to "mu" and looks like it could belong to the end of the sign, but it is almost certainly "šu₂".
   N 4210 obv. 5': ma-MU [. . .]
  UG k.1 31: ma-mu-šu₂-a-ta ma e₂-gal-<mah> [. . .] (var. u₅ ze₂-eb ku₄-ku₄-ta)
  Loehnert 225-26: notes that this temple is a shrine of Ninlil in the Kiur. She cites Urnammu B 31: ŋa₂-ŋiš-šu₂-a e₂ gal mah di gal ku₅-ru-da-ni as a parallel.
The Mamushua, the great palace (where Ninlil determines great verdicts). This and the following three lines and their parallels are discussed in SKL 82f. as parallels to VS 2, 25 i 7-11.

  N 4210 obv. 6': eš₃ <e₂> <gal>? [. . .]
  NOTE: there are no obvious parallels to this line in UG or Zb. In one of the Isin temple litanies the temple eš₃ e₂ gal mah [e₂ zi-de₃] occurs, though the traces of the sign after "e₂" here do not really support "gal". See also O. 53 obv. 15f.: e₂ mah, ka₂ silim-ma, hur-saŋ galam-ma, ka₂ gal ki ku₃, ka₂ še nu-ku₅, ma-mu-šu₂-a, ma e₂ gal mah, du₆ ku₃ ki ku₃, ša₃ e₂-dim₂-ma, eš₃ mah-e bur ..., unu₂ mah, e₂ za₃ ŋiš ..., an-ne₂ ma ..., aš-te ki ..., etc.

6': *du₆ *ku₃ *ki *nam-*tar-*tar-<*re> [. . .]
  N 4210 obv. 7': <*du₆> *ku₃ *ki *na-*aŋ₂ [. . .]
  UG k.1 41 = Zb 39: du₆-ku₃ ki ku₃ na-aŋ₂ tar-tar-ra-zu

The "holy hill", [the pure place where fate is determined].

7': *ša₃ *e₂-*dim₃-*ma *a-*a {d}mu-<*ul>-[lil₂]-<*ta>
  NOTE: small possibility that the first sign is "šu" but "ša₃" is more probable. The traces of the last sign on the tablet edge are consistent with "ta" in the following lines.
  N 4210 obv. 8': *ša₃ *e₂-*dim₃-<*ma> [. . .]
  UG k.1 42 = Zb 40: ša₃ e₂-dim₂-ma ki nam ma-al-la-zu (var. a-a {d}mu-ul-lil₂ ...)
  Loehnert 233f. has a commentary to this line, in which she cites other instances in which this temple name appears, and cites Cavigneaux who translates "dim₂" as "figurine".

In the midst of the Edimma, [the place where fate is placed].

8': *eš₃ *mah-<*e> *bur *šu₂-*šu₂-*a-*ta
  N 4210 obv. 10': <*eš₃> *mah!-*e <*bur> [. . .]

From the majestic shrine, covered with bur-vessels.

9': *unu₂(TE.ABxEŠ)-<mah>-*e *ki gibil(*NExPAP) *du₃-a-ta
  NOTE: "mah" almost entirely broken, but traces are consistent with it. Also, it is possible that the sign read as "gibil" is "eŋ₃", but the inscribed "PAP" is relatively certain, so "gibil" might be more probable. Note also that "aŋ₂" in l. 14' looks different, so this sign is almost certainly not "aŋ₂".
  N 4210 obv. 11': unu₂(TE!.A.UNUG) *mah <x> [. . .]
  Parallel texts: unu₂ mah ki sikil du₃-a-zu (ki lal₃-e dur₂-ru-na)
  See Loehnert 235 for parallel sources with this and the following lines.

The great dining hall [which is built on a purified place].

10': *e₂ *za₃ ŋiškiri₆ *gu₂ *tul¬₂ *eš₃-a-ta
  NOTE: the sign read as za₃ could be a different sign
  N 4210 obv. 12': *e₂ *za₃ *ŋiš*kiri₆ [. . .]
  Parallel texts: e₂ za₃ ŋiškiri₆ gu₂ tul₂ eš₃-a-zu

House on the side of the garden, [the edge of the well for the shrine].

11': *an!(DILI)-*ne₂ *mar-*ra <*aš>-<*te> <*ki>? <*sikil>?-*ta
  NOTE: it is entirely possible that the sign at the beginning of the line is a poorly written and tightly squeezed AN. Also, ki-sikil is likely in light of the parallel sources with the same line. The traces of the sign read as "ki" are more certain than the following sign, but it is possible that "sikil" was simply tightly squeezed here.
  N 4210 obv. 13': *an-*ne₂ *ma-<*ra> [. . .]
  Parallel texts: an-ne₂ mar-ra aš-te ki sikil-zu

[The throne of the pure place] established by An.

  N 4210 obv. 14': <*uru₂> *u₃-*mu-*un [. . .]
  NOTE: no traces of a sign inside of URU₂ are visible in N 4210.
  NOTE: this line and the next do not have any obvious parallels in other sources, suggesting that the temple litany ends here and is followed by a new passage.
  CBS 497+ ii 10: uru₂ u₃-mu-un-e en li-[bi₂-in-tar-ra-bi] 

After the lord no longer concerned himself with the storehouse/city.

13': *u₃-*mu-*un-*e {d}mu-ul-*lil₂-*le *lil₂-*la₂ *ku₄-*ra [<<erased "ba"?>>]
  NOTE: there is only space for one sign after "ra" at the end of the line and it is possible that it is an erased "ba". There are definitely traces of "ba" after "ra", but it is possible that the sign was erased.
  N 4210 obv. 15': [x] <*mu>-*un-*e [. . .]
  CBS 497+ ii 11: u¬₃-mu-un-e {d} [. . .]

And after the lord, Enlil, banished it to the wind.

14': <erim₃>? [x (x)] <*un>-*bi *na-*aŋ₂ *ba-*da-*an-*ku₅
  NOTE: there is only one sign after "aŋ₂" and before "da" and that sign could be either "ba" or "ŋa₂", but there is no possibility that both signs are written here. The "da" is also completely certain. "uru₂" is possible at the beginning of the line, but there is definitely not enough space for "u₃" and "mu" in the break following the first sign.
  N 4210 obv. 16': [. . .] <x> [. . .]
  Rest of obverse in N 4210 is broken
EM 12: uru₂-ta umun-bi na-aŋ₂ ba-da-an-ku₅

Its lord cursed the city.

15': <*ga>-<*ša>-<*an>-*bi *gig-<*+gig>-**a <*ba>-*da-*an-*tuš
  NOTE: the sign after the first "gig" is definitely not "ga" and the traces really do suggest that it is another "gig".
Collation June 2016: the sign after the first "gig" is either "ga" or a very tightly squeezed "gig", and though "gig" is more likely, "ga" cannot be ruled out completely.
EM 13: ga-ša-an-bi gig-gig-bi ba-da-an-tuš
CBS 497+ ii 9: ga-ša-an-bi gi-gi-a [. . .]

Its mistress sat there bitterly.

16': mu-*lu *ir₂-**ra-**ke₄ *ir₂ *mu-*ni-*ib-*be₂
  NOTE: the "ra" and the "ke₄¬" are squeezed together, but they are probably both there.
EM 16: mu-lu ir₂-ra-ke₄ ir₂ mu-un-še₈-še₈
CBS 497+ ii 12: lu₂ ir₂-ra-ke₄ ir₂ [. . .]

The wailer wails there. 

18': *mu-*KU-*de₃ <*du₉>-<*du₉> <*mu>-<*ni>-*ib-<*be₂>
  NOTE: it is really difficult to determine whether the sign read as "LU" in this and the preceding two lines is "LU" or "KU". It is also not impossible that the sign in this line is "KU", but that the preceding two lines have "LU". There are traces of a sign after "de₃", but they are impossible to reconstruct on the basis of what is now preserved on the tablet. The last sign in the line is probably "be₂", but it is also possible that it is a sign like "gi₄".
Collation June 2016: the traces of the signs read as "du₉-du₉" are consistent with this sign (BUR₂), but the traces are very faint. The sign read as "KU" is definitely "KU".
EM 18: mu-nu₁₂-de₃ du₉(BUR₂)-du₉ mu-ni-ib-be₂
  See Loehnert 335f. for an extensive discussion of the verb du₉-du₉ -- du₁₁, which is clearly some sort of action performed with a butter churn, and may here refer to a noise similar to the noise made by a churn when it is being churned.

Text 4: Unfinished Lament

&&CBS 10417 (unpublished): a middle fragment from the left edge of a multi-column tablet, with 3+ columns on the obverse and three columns on the reverse which are completely uninscribed but have the rulings for columns, demonstrating the scribe had intended to put texts in these empty columns or had misjudged the length of the text and did not need this space to complete the copy. Each column is 1 1/4-1 1/2 inches in width.

obv.
col. i
beginning of the column broken
1': še <<erasure>> [. . .] / (very slightly indented): uru₂-ŋu₁₀-*uš <a> [. . .]
  Note: it is possible that the scribe wrote "TU" and erased everything after the first part of the sign. It is also possible, however, that the scribe had written "še-eb" and then erased it. Note also that it is possible that the sign read as "UŠ" is "gin₇"

<The brickwork>? ... / toward my city <father> [Enlil]?

2': u₃-mu-<un> <ka!>-[na-aŋ₂-ŋa₂] / <<uru₂-ŋu₁₀-<*uš> <x> <x> <x> >>
  Note: the scribe has intentionally erased the second part of "KA" and possibly everything after it. In the second part of the line, the entire line and line in adjacent column have been entirely erased by scribe so that only faint traces of a few signs remain. Note also that the sign after "ŋu₁₀" in the second part of the line is almost certainly identical the corresponding sign after "uru₂-ŋu₁₀" in the second part of the preceding line.
  Note also: wherever it appears "u₃-mu-un ka-na-aŋ₂-ŋa₂" is an epithet of Enlil.

Note also everything from AN (in am₃) until the end of the second part of the line seems to have been erased by the scribe.

NOTE: for this and the following line see Krecher SKL 201f.. In addition to occurring in SK 25, vii 51-52, they are also attested in a number of 1st millennium sources, including SBH 14: 13-17, SBH 1: 4-14, and a couple others listed by Krecher. Of interest is also that the passages with these lines also contain epithets of Enlil which are similar to those found at the end of col. ii (further proof that this fragment belongs to the same tablet as BM 81014+)

3: *uru₂-*na *nibru*{ki}-*na *hul-*lu!(KU) *mu-*un-<*ku₄>-[ku₄]
  NOTE: where preserved the last preserved sign after mu-un- in this and the following lines is definitely a sign that begins with "ŠE", so if the sign is not "ku₄", then "mu₂" and "LI" are also possible.
  NOTE: SK 25 (VAT 618+), viii 1f., the passage following the epithets of Enlil in the preceding lines, seems to continue with several lines ending with the phrase ... hul-lu mu-un [. . .]. Krecher cites SBH 33 rev. 1f. and 4 R 11 (K.4613) rev. 5f. as possible parallels in SKL 201 and 203. Note that 4 R 11 is a 1st. version of Enlil, the Merchant. See Loehnert 137 for a description of the tablet.

9: <*še>-<*eb> <*e₂> <*saŋ>?-<*il₂>? [. . .]
  NOTE: given that the standard "OB litany from north Babylonia", as listed by Gabbay in HES 1, 34 ends with Tintir followed by Esagil (before continuing in longer versions with the Ezida, Kish, the Ekishib, Emeteursag, Hursagkalama, Eturkalama, Kutha, Emeslam, Dilbat, and the Ibianna -- see the end of the text, where the complete litany occrs in CBS 497+), it is likely that the reconstruction of the last two preserved signs in this line is correct. Also, given the amount of broken space on the tablet before the tablet resumes with a different section, it is likely that this section of the text ended with the Esagil and did not continue with the complete litany here or anywhere else on the tablet.
  SBH 33 rev. 11': še-eb e₂-saŋ-il₂-la-ta hul [. . .]

NOTE: from this point on, the content of this source does not overlap with the content of CT 42, 1 rev. 36'f. or the other 1st mill. sources with the preceding lines. The closest parallel is VAT 607 (VS 2, 11) + AO 3924 (TCL 15, 1) obv. col. iv 13'-15', in which col. iv 9'-12' also directly overlap with l.1'-4' of BM 81014+. Note that this source begins with the incipit "a gal-gal buru₁₄ su-su" and seems to be a source containing the Balag with the same name.

1': [. . .] <x> nin-<bi>? [. . .]
  NOTE: it is possible that the sign read as "nin" is "dam", especially since "dam" and "nin" seem to be written in almost identical form throughout the source (compare, in particular, the writing of "NIN" in {d}nin-sumun₂-na in col. v l.4, which is virtually indistinguishable from "dam" in l.3' below).

2': [. . .] <*am₃>-*ma-<x> [. . .]

3': [. . .] <*lu₂> *dam *ba [. . .] / [. . .] *lu₂ *dumu-<*na> [. . .]
  NOTE: the closest parallel I could find to this is a section of BM 85198 obv. 31'-32' (CT 42, 16, pl.30) = Source C in Krecher's edition (ZA 58: 30f.) of the same composition (with parallels in VAT 1367, BM 78173, and VAT 1419) = lines 28-29 in his edition of the text. BM 85198 is identified in the colophon as an Ershemma of Inana, although the section of the text with these lines is about Enlil and reads:
  31': lu dam-ra dam mu-un-na-an-ze₂-eŋ₃-men₃ mu-e mu-un-na-KU-en
  32': lu dumu-ra dumu mu-un-na-an-ze₂-eŋ₃-men₃ mu-e mu-un-na-KU-en
= lu¬₂ dam/dumu ... ŋa₂-e mu-na-KU(-en) in source B = BM 78173 (CT 44, 15) obv. 25-26. 
   Krecher (p.53) translates: "Dem, der einen Gatten hat, gibst du den Gatten ...; Dem, der ein Kind hat, gibst du das Kind ...", without further commentary. Cohen, who translates this part of the text in his edition of BM 15793 = Ersh. no.171, pp.96-103, also leaves the second part of the lines untranslated, but translates the first part: "You are the one who gave the spouse to her who is married" (etc.). In any case, it is clear from both passages that somebody (probably the goddess) is appealing to Enlil directly in the first person, and since the speaker seems to be appealing to Enlil's power to determine fates, it is likely that these lines are meant in the positive sense of Enlil being the one who gives wives and children to people. 
Similar lines also seem to occur in BM 15793 (CT 42, 7) col. ii 4-5, an Ershemma to Gula (Cohen Ers. no. 177), also in a passage about Enlil (Krecher identifies this as "Source D" for the text from which the other lines are quoted).

1: *nin!(NIN₉) *niŋ₂-*gur₁₁-*ra-<*ke₄>? [. . .]
  NOTE: the phrase "nin(₉) niŋ-gur₁₁-ra" also occurs in BM 87518 (CT 42, 15) col. iii 7 in a context parallel to the Balag "His Word is a Wail", 1st mill. version l.65 (in Cohen's edition = CLAM 191), where Kalkal is being instructed to open the door for Inana, who is waiting outside (the 1st mill. version has nin niŋ₂-ŋa₂-ra). Cohen also transliterates BM 87518 separately as a source with this passage on pp.193f., where the same phrase occurs as an epithet of Inana in a similar context. However, the occurrence of the epithet "nin erim₃-ma" with Ninlil (in BM 23631 obv. col. i 4, for example) makes it likely that this line and the next line refer to Ninlil.
  VAT 1357 (Source C for tablet that joins CBS 497 and VAT 1334) col. iv 1': nin <GA> [. . .] / [. . .]. It is also important to note that there is a break of approximately 3, maximum 4 lines between these lines in VAT 1334 (which continue to the end of col. iv) and the last preserved line in the same column of VAT 1334+ (which belongs to the tablet), so it should be possible at this point to compare how the text preserved in this source differs from BM 81014+ in this section of the composition.

2: *ama *gal *{d}!*nin-<*lil₂> [. . .]
  NOTE: the "{d}" sign seems to have been written over another sign, but reading {d}nin-lil₂ after ama gal is much more probable both epigraphically and contextually than ušumgal, which essentially never occurs without "an-na", except when it is used to mean 'dragon'.

  NOTE: the lines in this section are entirely consistent with Cohen's restoration of col. v 1-8 of CBS 497+ (as preserved in VAT 1334). Since this section of the text in CBS 497+ is immediately followed by lines that are parallel to the remaining lines in BM 81014, the likelihood that the lines in this section are also parallel is great. To restore these lines, Cohen relies on AO 3924 (TCL 15, 2) rev. iii reverse 1'-10'. Since these lines do seem to be parallel to CBS 497+ and AO 3924 also contains lines that are parallel to earlier portions of BM 81014, this reconstruction is likely.

  NOTE: the sign after "in" in this line in the next begins with two evenly aligned Winkelhaken, making it unlikely that the sign is "šub"; moreover, there really does seem to be an "UD" after the end of this sign in l.9, and the traces of the sign that precede UD in that line, while not decisive, are also not inconsistent with "TU". NOTE also that the parallel line in AO 3924 also has a sign that begins with two evenly aligned Winkelhaken, decreasing the likelihood that this sign is "šub" even further.

  NOTE: the signs read as guru₇ are relatively certain, but the signs read as du₆ and maš are less clear from the photo than they are on the copy, and should probably be restored this way tentatively. Also, there appears to be no trace left at all of the sign Cohen reads as "a".

11: [mu e₂ du₃-a mu-ŋu₁₀ pad₃-de₃] <*mu>-<*ŋu₁₀> <*nu>-*pad₃-*de₃
  NOTE: for the probability of this restoration see the note to the first line of col. vi where the parallels with CBS 497+ are noted. There is space for approximately 7 signs in the break before mu-ŋu₁₀, which is not quite enough for the eight signs in the restored phrase, but if the signs were squeezed, or one of the signs was omitted it could work. If the source follows AO 3924 here, a better restoration might be [en me-en nu-pad₃-de₃] mu-ŋu₁₀ etc.

This seems very unlikely, however, and misses the significance of the switch from the negation of pad₃ in the preceding too lines (which Cohen ignores entirely!), followed by its use in the indicative in this and the following lines.

  CBS 497 + VAT 1357 rev. v 7': UD.KIB.NUN{ki} {d}utu-<gin₇> za-e-ta / e₃ <bar>-ra
     NOTE: this is the last line in the column and it seems to be followed by a single dividing line.

Make Sippar come out [from you] like the sun! 

col. vi
BM 81014+
  NOTE: A similar litany of temple and place names followed by the phrase "{d}utu-gin₇ za-e ta e₃ bar-ra" occurs in CBS 497 + VAT 1334 (+) VAT 1357 rev. col. v 15'-19' (preserved in CBS 497 + VAT 1357) through col. vi 1'-2' (preserved in VAT 1334) - a parallel source for Uruhalake of Gula. These lines are immediately followed (in VAT 1334) by a call to have the same temples restored (in lines ending with the phrase he₂-du₃-e), including a pair of lines (vi 8'-9') which begin with the temple names e₂-di-ku₅-kalam-ma (8') and TIN.TIR{ki} (9'), just as in lines 2-3 of this column below. Since the section with this litany is immediately preceded (in VAT 1334 col. v 2'-3') by a section which begins with lines ending with the phrase mu-ŋu₁₀ nu-pad₃-de₃, given the parallels between this source and BM 81014+, it is not improbably that the ends of lines 11-12 in col. v are to be restored 11: [. . .] <mu>-<ŋu₁₀> nu-pad₃-de₃ // 12: [. . .] ŋu₁₀ nu / [pad₃-de₃]. 
  NOTE also that given that only three temples are missing between Sippar and Babylon (the Ebabbar, the Edikukalma, and the Ulmash), it is clear that col. iv of VAT 1334+ is missing only three lines from the text before the first preserved lines in the column, which correspond to BM 81014+ vi 4f.
1: *e₂-*babbar₂(UD.UD) {d}utu-gin₇ *za-*e-*ta / *e₃ *bar-*ra

Make the Ebabbar come out from you like the sun!
Cohen translates: "Cause the Ebabbar to go forth from you like the sun."

2: *e₂ *di-*ku₅ *kalam-*ma *{d}*utu-*gin₇ *za-*e-*ta / *e₃ *bar-*ra
  NOTE: the copy of this tablet in CT 58 is missing "ku₅", but the sign is completely clear on the tablet. 

Make the Edikukalama come out from you like the sun!

3: ul-maš {d}utu-gin₇ za-e-ta / e₃ bar-ra

Make the Ulmash come out from you like the sun!

4: <*TIN>.TIR{ki} {d}utu-gin₇ za-e-ta / e₃ bar-ra
  VAT 1334 rev. vi 1': [TIN.TIR{ki} {d}utu]-<gin₇> <za>-<e> / [ta] <e₃> bar-<ra>

  VAT 1334 rev. vi 2': [e₂ saŋ-il₂ {d}utu]-<*gin₇> za-e <ta> / <bar>-<ra>

[Make the Esagil] come out from you like [the sun]!

The rest of BM 81014+ is broken, but the remaining lines are likely to follow VAT 1334, which has the following lines:

  VAT 1334 rev. vi 3': [. . . e₂-zu] <*he₂>-du₃-e

... may your temple be rebuilt!
  VAT 1334 rev. vi 4': [. . .] <zu> uru₂-zu he₂-du₃-e

... your ... may your city be rebuilt!

  VAT 1334 rev. vi 5': [. . .] <zu>? EN.LIL₂{ki} / [. . .] <he₂>-<du₃>-e
      NOTE: the temples in this litany are reconstructed (when they are not preserved) from the "OB litany from north Babylonia", as listed by Gabbay in HES 1: 43.

... your ... may Nippur be rebuilt!

  VAT 1334 rev. vi 6': [e₂-kur he₂]-<*du₃>-*e

[May the Ekur] be rebuilt!

  VAT 1334 rev. vi 7': [ki-ur₃ ki gal] <he₂>-du₃-e

May [the Kiur, the great place] be rebuilt!

  VAT 1334 rev. vi 8': [UD].<KIB>.<NUN><{ki}> <he₂>[-du₃-e e¬₂-babbar₂ he₂ ]-<du₃>-e

  VAT 1334 rev. vi 9': e₂ di-ku₅-kalam-ma <*he₂>-[du₃-e] <*ul>-<*maš> <*he₂>-<*du₃>-<*e>
      NOTE: Gabbay HES 1: 42 notes that the Ulmash referred to here is probably not the Ulmash at Agade, but rather the Ulmash of Anunnitum at Sippar, which he takes as a further indication that sources with this litany, including this one, are probably from Sippar.

May the Edikukalama be rebuilt! May the Ulmash be rebuilt!

  VAT 1334 rev. vi 10': TIN.TIR{ki} he₂-du₃-*e *saŋ-*il₂ he₂-du₃-e

May Babylon be rebuilt! May the [E]sagil be rebuilt!

  VAT 1334 rev. vi 11': e₂-zi-da he₂-du₃-e kiš{ki} he₂-du₃-e

NOTE: Gabbay HES 1, 42 suggests that the Ezida referred to here is not the temple of Nabu, but instead a temple of Tutu-Marduk, citing (in fn.171) Pomponio in RlA 9: 17 and George in House Most High no.1236. 

May the Ezida be rebuilt! May Kish be rebuilt!

  VAT 1334 rev. vi 12': e₂-kišib he₂-du₃-e e₂-me-te-ur-saŋ / he₂-du₃-e
     NOTE: Gabbay reads the first temple name as "e₂-dub(-ba)" on the basis of the first millennium version of the temple litany, but since "Edubba" is almost always written e₂-dub-ba-a in the OB period, Ekishib seems more likely. 

May the Ekishib be rebuilt! May the Emeteursag be rebuilt!

  VAT 1334 rev. vi 13': hur-saŋ-kalam-ma he₂-du₃-e e₂-tur₃-kalam-ma / he₂-du₃-e

May the Hursagkalama be rebuilt! May the Eturkalama be rebuilt!

  VAT 1334 rev. vi 14': <gu₂>?-du₈-a{ki} he₂-du₃-<e> <e₂>-<mes>-<*lam> he₂-du₃-e

May Kutha be rebuilt! May the Emeslam be rebuilt!
  VAT 1334 rev. vi 15': [dil]-<*bat><*{ki}> [he₂-du₃-e e₂-i]-<*bi₂>-<*an>-<*na> / [he₂-du₃-e] 

May Dilbat be rebuilt! May the Eibianna be rebuilt!

  The rest of the column is broken in VAT 1334

  CBS 497 vi 1': [. . .] <he₂>?-<du₃>? [. . .]
  These two signs are followed by blank space on the tablet, so they either belong to a colophon or the scribe stopped writing after this line. If these signs are read correctly (from the photo the du₃ looks reasonably certain, but the he₂ is less certain - and the tablet must be collated again to check this), then these two signs could belong to the last part of the line in VAT 1334 rev. vi 15'. If this is the case, then the tablet would have ended with this line, and there would not have been a colophon or even a double-dividing line at the end of the tablet to indicate that the composition was finished suggesting, possibly, that the scribe stopped writing before the text was complete.

rest of column broken

---------------------
---------------------

CBS 497, like VAT 1334 and VAT 1357 was at tablet with three columns per side, and its belonging to these other two pieces is entirely certain on the grounds that when the first preserved lines in col. i of VAT 1334+ begin they contain lines ending with the signs e-en NI a-ri, just like the lines at the ends of the preserved lines in CBS 497. CBS 497 contains the beginnings of columns i and ii on the obverse and the ends of columns v and vi on the reverse, and VAT 1334+ contains the continuation of columns i and ii as well as lines from the middle of column iii and lines from the middles of all three columns on the reverse. VAT 1357 (VS 2, 16) which contains the ends of rev. columns iv and v joins CBS 497 at the end of col. v (where it contains the ends of the same lines) and is separated from the end of the preserved part of col. iv in VAT 1334+ by a break of no more than 3-4 lines. The entire source is "Source J", an "Old Babylonian Parallel Text" in Cohen's edition of Uruhulake of Gula (pp.253f.). 

The first line in CBS 497 col i reads u₄-ri u₄-ri-gin₇(OR: da!) te bi/ga-bi/ga-ni, which is followed by:
  CBS 497 col. i 2: ŋi₆-ri ŋi₆-ri-gin₇(OR: da!) te bi/ga-bi/ga-ni

  CBS 497 col. ii (and its continuation in VAT 1334+) contains lines that are very similar to the text "Enlil the Merchant" and read:

  The rest of the column is broken in CBS 497, but here it is clear that the bottom of l.10 is preserved in the first preserved line of col. ii of VAT 1334+ which reads:

Transliterations:

Abu Habbah Group

1) BM 78193 (CT 44, 13)
Bottom half of a single column tablet written in a very cursive script. One of many distinguishing features of the script is the consistent writing of "ir" with a shortened top diagonal preceded by the three vertical that usually go directly between the top and lower diagonal wedges. This is another source which I am attributing to the "Abu-Habbah" group; note also that in the catalogue of CT 44 both this source and BM 78198 are said to come from Abu-Habbah.

4': ama-ni₅ lu-li-ŋu₁₀ <*ŋa₂> <AB>? [. . .]
  Note: it is possible that the sign read as "ŋa₂" is "e₂", but "ŋa₂" is more likely.

N.S.: ama
T: 1 + 1 w.u. S, 1 N.S.; 2 + 1 w.u.

S: lu-li-ŋu¬₁₀ (for ???), tu-ra (for tur₃), and na-mu (for ???) and w.u. -ni₅ (for -ni)
N.S.: ama, mu-lu, and w.u. -na, nu-, -mu-, and -un-
T: 3 + 1 w.u. S, 2 + 4 w.u. N.S.; 5 + 5 w.u.
Uncertain: the most common verb that occurs with tur₃ and amaš in laments in -gul or any other verb of destruction, but the negation of the verb and the probability that mu-lu is the agent may point to a verb like AK or ŋa₂-ŋa₂.

Fritz 2003: 129 n.496 translates: "Seine Mutter hat ihren kranken Mann mit keinem 'Oh weh mir!' bekleidet", interpreting lu-li-ŋu₁₀ as being from a-li-lu instead of as lu-lim 'deer', like Krecher ZA 57 (1965): 18f.

7': ama-ni₅ lu-li-ŋu₁₀ mu-lu a-ma-sa₂-na (amaš-na) nu-mu-un-na-mu

8': ir im-ma-pad₃ *si!-*si i-ma-ma
  Note that the first "si" does not seem to have any wedges inside the box that makes up the rest of the sign, though the vertical wedge does appear in the second "si".

S: si-si (for isiš), ir (for ir₂), and w.u. i- (for i₃-)

11': ir tu-ra i-re ba-ŋa₂-ŋa₂ ši-ša nu-*uš₂(BAD)?-gu-le (gul-e)
  Note: the sign read as "uš₂" could be either another "nu" or "BAD" - since the sign is tightly squeezed on the tablet, it is difficult to determine which sign was intended with certainty.

S: ir, tu-ra (for tur-ra?), i-re, ši-ša (for isiš), gu-le (for gul-le), and w.u. nu-uš₂ (for nu-uš)
N.S. -ŋa₂, -ŋa₂ and w.u. ba-

Fritz 2003: 129 n.498 translates er-tu-re i-re ba-ŋa₂-ŋa₂ as "Die Klagende setze eine trauende Klage"

12': uru₂ i-ra nu-*DU! i-re ba-ni-ma-al
  Note: there seems to be a stray wedge with "DU" which may either be a mistake, or it may indicate šeššig-marking with "DU".

S: i-ra (for ir₂-ra), i-re
N.S.: uru₂, DU, ma-al and w.u. nu-, ba-, and -ni-
T: 2 S, 3 + 3 w.u. N.S.; 5 + 3 w.u.

Fritz 2003: 129 n.498 translates: "(In der) Stadt, die Klage nie geäussert(?) hatte, hat die Klagende sie vorhanden sein lassen". 

13': a-ši-ra nu-DU a-ši-ir ba-ni-ma-al

S: ir, ir, ši, ši-e (for šex) and w.u. i (for i₃)
N.S.: zu and w.u. nu- and -a
T: 4 + 1 w.u. S, 1 + 2 w.u. N.S.; 5 + 3 w.u.
Note: this and the following lines occur almost verbatim in normal ES orthography in MAH 16014 rev. 3f. (an Ershemma of Dumuzi with the lamenting reed) = 
  3: ir₂ nu-zu-a ir₂ i₃-še₈-še₈

T: 2 + 1 w.u. S, 3 + 2 w.u. N.S.; 5 + 3 w.u.

Following Fritz 2003: 129 n.500, this and the preceding line can be translated: "He who doesn't know lamenting, laments bitterly // He who doesn't know wailing, wails bitterly".

16': mi *ba-da-gu-bi (gub-be₂) mu-lu gu-ba(-)bi-ne-*ni(OR: ir)
  Note: the sign read as "ma" looks more like "ba" or possibly "KU". Note also that there appear to be only two wedges in the last sign in the line, making it possible that "ni" and not "ir" was intended.
S: mi (for ???), gu-be₂ (for gub-be₂), gu-ba (for gub-ba)
N.S.: mu-lu and w.u. ba- and -da-
T: 3 S, 1 + 2 w.u. N.S.; 4 + 2 w.u.
Uncertain: the significance of (-)bi-NE-ni(OR: ir) at the end of the line
Fritz 2003: 130 n.501 interprets this and the following lines to stand for: "ŋi₆-a ba-da-gub-ba-e mu-lu gub-ba bi₂-be₂-ne // ŋi₆-a ba-da-tuš-a-e mu-lu gub-ba bi₂-be₂-ne", which can be translated: "Those who stand by him in the night, say: 'Man, remain standing!', and those who sit by him in the night say: 'Remain standing, man!'.

N.S.: mu-lu and w.u. ba- and -da-
T: 3 S, 1 + 2 w.u. N.S.; 4 + 2 w.u.
Uncertain: the significance of (-)bi-NE-en at the end of the line

18': *ba-da-gu-ba mu ba-da-gu-bi

NOTE: for these lines and their parallels in PRAK C 118 rev. ii 17-19 and HS 1494 (TUM 3, 26), see Krecher ZA 57 (1965): 18f. In contrast to Civil in JNES 28 and Fritz 2003, Krecher interprets lu-li as a phonetic writing of lu-lim "deer", instead of as another word for "woe".

Fritz 2003: 130 n.503 considers the possibility that ta-ba is for tab-ba and translates the verb at the end of the line as "indem niemand ihn begleitet".

2) BM 78198 (CT 44, 14)
Bottom half of a single column tablet. - Note this is almost definitely a syllabically written incantation and or an Ershahunga, but almost certainly not a Balag or Ershemma. This source has all of the features of what I am tentatively calling the "Abu-Habbah" group, which is particularly evident in its ductus.

Note: it is possible that the sign read as "NE" is "ama" or "dumu", but this is very epigraphically uncertain

T: 3 S, 2 + 3 w.u. N.S.; 5 + 3 w.u.
Uncertain: IM

Main verbs that "a-še-er" occur with in this corpus are "kuš₂", "ŋar", and "la₂", but there are also a couple instances in which it occurs with "tuš", which increases the likelihood that "de-šu", which is epigraphically entirely certain, is a syllabic writing for "tuš".

12': *e-*ŋu₁₀ *e-*ši KA(-)*mi!(-)NE-*KU
  Note: the sign read as "mi" may be an animal-headed sign instead.

T: 3 + 1 w.u. S, 2 w.u. N.S.; 3 + 3 w.u.

N.S.: w.u. de₃-
T: 4 + 2 w.u. S; 1 w.u. N.S.; 4 + 3 w.u.

Note: given the apparent use of "NE" to write "-ni₅" later in the text, the possibility should be considered that the line should be read: e gu-ba(-)KA-ni₅ di-bi (he-me-en)

19': *e-ba bu-ru-da-ka gi-mu-*uš-ŋu₁₀ *hi-*me-*en
  Note: -me-en is squeezed on to the tablet edge, which may account for why the normal orthographic "me-en" was written instead of repeating the syllabic writing "mi-en" in the previous line.
  Note: it is possible that the sign read as "uš" is "AB" 

S: e, bu-ru-da (for ???), gi-mu-uš (for ???) and w.u. -ka (for -ŋa₂?) and he- (for he₂-)

7: nam-<*da> lu₂ lu₂ u₃ *me-*en a-ra u₃ me-en <*3 signs erased> 
  Note: I've noted that there is a possibility that the second sign is "ma", but that the traces really suggest "da" instead. When consulting the collation photo it is clear that the sign is definitely not "ma", but there is a possibility that the sign is "ama" instead of "da".

Uncertain: the interpretation of the entire line is uncertain. Possibilities include reading nam-da-lu₂-lu₂ as a partially syllabic writing of nam-lu₂-ulu₃, reading a-ra as a syllabic writing of "a-ra₂" ('way') and u₃-me-en as a syllabic verbal form with the prospective prefix u₃- at the beginning.

4) VAT 1344 (VS 2, 72)
Single column tablet, approximately the same size as some of the syllabically written single column tablets in the BM. Note also that this source exhibits a very strong resemblance to the sources in the "Abu Habbah Group" (BM 78193 and 78198) and to BM 78198 in particular, with which it shares a nearly identical ductus. 
Note: in all the lines on the obverse there are one and at the most two signs missing at the beginning of every line, and probably in most cases only one, particularly when the first preserved sign is partially broken.

Obv.
1: [x (x)] <*di/UD>? *ra *NE *di *ga-*na [. . .]

N.S.: di and w.u. ga- and -na-
T: 1 + 2 w.u. N.S.; 1 + 2 w.u.
Uncertain: everything else in the line, particular the reading and significance of "NE".

2: [x (x)] <*KA>?-*su-*ku(OR: lu) {d}utu NE {d}utu-ra NE [di] <*ga>-*na-*ab-*DU

4: [x (x)] <*NE> *{d}*nin(EGI₂)-*gal NE {d}utu-ra *NE *di ga-na-ab-DU 
  Note: there is a small, but not very likely, possibility that the sign read as "gal" is "KU" with a stray horizontal wedge to the right of the middle of the sign.

S: DU
N.S.: {d}nin-gal, {d}utu, di and w.u. ga-, -na-, -ab-
T: 1 S, 3 + 3 w.u. N.S.; 4 + 3 w.u.

S: NE-re (for ???), ne-re
N.S.: me-en 
T: 2 S, 1 N.S.; 3
Uncertain: the significance of NE-re is uncertain, by the form is almost certainly syllabic. The significance of the final NE in the line, on the other hand is entirely uncertain.

6: [x x (x)] <*x> *nu-*um-*ki-*NE '' *me-*en

S: (...)nu-um-ki (for ???)
N.S. me-en
T: 1 S, 1 N.S.; 2
Uncertain: signifance of NE at the end of [. . .] nu-um-ki

7: [. . .] <x> *di ga-na-ab-<*DU> *di-*bi *ha-ma-*ku-*de
  Note: there is a small vertical wedge at the top left corner of the second to last sign, making it look more like "ma" than like "KU"; it should be noted, however, that this vertical wedge is not present in the previous sign, which is wider, and almost certainly "ma". Maybe "zu" is a possibility?

9: [. . .] <*a>? *{d}*utu *MU *im-*DU-*ta *mi-*te-*IŠ-*e *ga-*e
  Note: it is not possible that the sign read as "IŠ" is "da" or "a₂", since there is a diagonal wedge in the middle of the left side of the sign that makes it look more like "IŠ" than "da" (see collation drawing). Since this distinctive feature is also present in the corresponding sign in the next two lines and is particularly clear in the second of these two lines, "IŠ" is almost completely certain. Note also that the sign read as "MU" could also be "bur₂" or a similar sign, as there is possibly as faint vertical wedge connecting the first two Winkelhaken at the beginning of the sign.

S: mi (for me), te-IŠ (for teš₂), -e (for i-i), and DU
N.S.: {d}utu and w.u. im-, -ta, ga- and -e

Note: the correct writing of me in me-teš₂ after writing it syllabically as "MI" in the preceding line.

17: [x] <x> *a *ŋa₂!-*bi! *nu-*un-zu NI(-)mu-ši-ma-al-<*le> [. . .]
  Note: the sign after "a" has the outer frame of "šu", but since there are two faint vertical wedges at the bottom left side of the sign, "ŋa₂" and not "šu" was clearly intended. Note also that "bi" seems to have been written over an erased "ta" since the vertical wedge following "bi" looks like it has been erased.

Possibly Abu Habbah Group:

1) BM 16901 (CT 42, 38)
A single column tablet, which I've noted has an almost identical format to BM 78193, BM 78198, and BM 78175, all of which are also single column tablets with texts written in a highly syllabic orthography, with similar rulings and ductus. Most strikingly, this tablet has the same irregularly shaped top-edge which has an indentation between lines 3-5 so that the first two lines protrude further from the surface than the lines below it - a feature which is also possessed by BM 78175. It seems very, very likely that all four of these tablets belong to a distinct group that may have been produced by the same scribe.

3) AO 3925 (TCL 15, 4), possibly (even probably?) Abu Habbah group. Duplicates lines from Shulpae A, which is preserved in the following sources:

Shulpae A (A: VAT 6110 = VS 2, 78; B: BM 87594 = CT 42, 43, pl.47; C: AO 3925 = TCL 15, 4 = (Krecher ZA 58: 29 - normal dialect, syllabic); D: Edin 09.405-27 = BL pl. VI)
Note that source B = BM 87594 has been altered by the dealer so that only the top left corner of a multi-column tablet with the beginnings of two columns are preserved, but the edges have been smoothed over to make it look like the tablet is complete, concealing that columns i and ii continue beyond the edge and that only the first halves of the lines in col. ii are preserved.

6) VAT 1384 (VS 2, 77): middle fragment from a single column tablet.
Note: I noted that this source definitely belongs to the "Abu Habbah group", but on closer inspection, the only indication that it could belong to this group is the characteristic writing of the "ga" sign, but since more of the source is not preserved, it is difficult to determine on the basis of the few preserved syllabic writings whether the source belonged to this group.

7) VAT 3416 (VS 10, 117): top right corner of a thin tablet, which is uninscribed in the preserved part of the reverse and which probably belonged to a multi-column tablet, judging by the size of the signs. On basis of ductus, there is a strong likelihood that this source belongs to the Abu Habbah group. - Note almost all of the lines in this source are directly parallel to BM 54323 + (CT 58, 36) = DIL no. 22 obv. 1f., making it very likely that this source contains the same composition.

The closest parallels to these lines, however, are in BM 54323 + BM 59692 (DIL no. 22) obv. 3f. and VAT 604+ obv. col. i 19f., the former of which duplicates nearly every preserved line in this source, and the latter of which duplicates this couplet of lines as well as VAT 3416 l.5, but otherwise seems to contain a different composition, with parallel content.

8) VAT 3529 (VS 10, 170): a middle fragment from a very thick tablet with the same format and ductus as many of the other syllabically written single column tablets in the collection. The tag in the box with the tablet has a note saying it belongs to the same tablet as VAT 3527 and VAT 3578, but note this piece is much thicker than VAT 3527, so if it does belong to the same tablet it must be from further up in the obverse. It may, however, be better to assume that these pieces belong to different tablets.
Note also: on basis of ductus and thickness of tablet almost certainly Abu Habbah group and NOT h.s.s.c. group

Possibly AH Group. Identified by Bergmann ZA 57: 33 as "ein kassitischer Text". Bergmann also notes that the text may be an Ershahunga.

The sign read as "eŋ₃" is definitely either "eŋ₃" or "ur₂", but note that the bottom right side of the sign seems to have been erased; also when this sign is compared with "ur₂" in lines 5 and 7, it seems more likely that it is "eŋ₃" and not "ur₂".

  Group 2: Highly Syllabic, Single Column Tablets

1) VAT 1442 (VS 2, 53): top half of a single column tablet with the same ductus and format as the other single column, syllabic sources in the collection + VAT 1414 (VS 2, 96): another single column tablet with the same format and ductus as the other syllabic single column tablets in this collection. Note also that "sa" is written the same characteristic way as it typically is in these sources. Note finally that the lines from the obverse continue on to the bottom edge of the tablet and then seamlessly on to the reverse without a break or blank space.

[NOTE: in the older version of this file VAT 1414 and VAT 1442 were treated as separate sources - it now seems reasonably certain, however, that they belong to the same tablet]
VAT 1442 (for VAT 1414 see below):

Uncertain: significance of KA

2: <*e₂> *ku₃ *e₂ *šen!(u₅)-*na *KA *mu-*un-*tuku [(x) (x)]
  Note: in this and the following lines the edge of the tablet is broken after "tuku", but it is unlikely that any signs were written on it.
  Note also that the sequence e₂ ku₃ e₂ šen-na occurs at three other times in the corpus (BM 29615 rev. l.6; VAT 1423, rev. l.5, and in kirugu 4 of Uruamairabi. Note also the syllabic writing in PRAK B 307 obv. 3': e₂ ku₃ e₂ še-na, all of which support reading šen!-na in this source.

N.S.: tuku and w.u. mu- and -un-
T: 1 S, 1 + 2 w.u. N.S.; 2 + 2 w.u.
Uncertain: significance of ma and the two KA signs

6: dumu ni-*ŋa₂-*ar *ki *ku₃-*ga *KA *mu-<*un> [. . .] [x (x) (x)]
  Note: the sheer number of times the phrase ki ku₃-ga is preceded by ga-ša-an-niŋin₃-ŋar in this corpus strongly suggests that a truncated, syllabic version of her name is intended here and in the preceding line.

S: ni-ŋa₂-ar (for ga-ša-an-niŋin₃-ŋar)
N.S.: ki, ku₃ and w.u. -ga, mu-, and -un-

  Note: it is very difficult to determine whether the wedge inside the sign read as "e₂" is horizontal or vertical, making it very difficult to determine whether the sign is "e₂", "ma", or possibly even "ba", since the bottom horizontal wedge may slant slightly downward.

S: ši-im (for šim)
T: 1 S, 0 N.S.; 1
Uncertain: since "šim" is very frequenty preceded by ŋištir and followed by ŋišeren, it is reasonable to expect the signs after "ši-im" to be ŋišeren, but the traces of the first sign really do look more like "e₂" than "ŋiš".

  Note: it is possible that there is a small vertical wedge at the top of the sign read as "KU" that would make the sign "lu" instead, but "ku" seems more likely. Note also that it is difficult to determine whether the sign read as "KA" in the second part of the line is "KA" or "ŋa₂", but "KA" seems more likely.

11': <*am>? <x> [. . .]
  Note: given the frequency of the occurrence of the sequence of lines am erin₂ // u₃ lul-la in the standard epithets of Enlil, "am erin₂-na" would be expected here. 

12': *u₃ *lu-*la <*ka>? <x> [. . .]
  Note: the first sign in the line is very tightly squeezed and partly broken in the diagnostic places for "u₃" and "hul", making it very difficult to determine which of the two signs was intended.

16': *u₃-*mu-*un <*mu>?-<*KU>? '' *me *AŠ [. . .]
  Note: it is possible that the sign read as "mu" is "bi" and the sign read as "KU" is "a", "še₃", or an erased sign.

N.S: u₃-mu-un

Entire line uncertain

18': <*AN>? <*zu>? <x> <x> <DU>? '' nu?(-)me *AŠ <x> [. . .]
  Note: it is possible that the first sign is "bad" instead of "nu" or that this and the following two signs are to be read "AŠ di me!" with "me" using the final vertical wedge of "di" and adding a horizontal wedge to it in writing "me".

Entire line uncertain

Bottom edge:

22': [. . .] <x> *šu-*šu-*de₃
  Note: this is the line into which the signs from the first line on the obverse continue into, so it is possible that the scribe did not have enough space to finish this line.

S: u₃(-bi)
N.S.: di and w.u. -da, ba-, -da-, and -ab-
T: 1 S, 1 + 4 w.u. N.S.; 2 + 4 w.u.
Uncertain: whether "ga" is the intended verb or whether this is the first sign in a verb written syllabically (like "gam") or whether -bi in both instances is a possessive suffix or part of a word written syllabically with the sign preceding it. 

24': [. . .] <x> *bi *di-*da *e *ba-*da-*ab-*ga [(x)]

S: e (for e₂)
N.S.: di and w.u. -da, ba-, -da-, and -ab-
T: 1 S, 1 + 4 w.u. N.S.; 2 + 4 w.u.
Uncertain: whether "ga" is the intended verb or whether this is the first sign in a verb written syllabically (like "gam")

------ Note: there seems to be a faint dividing line after this line near the bottom of the bottom edge of the tablet which is followed by traces of two or three signs just above "KA" and "mu" and then another possible, even smaller two signs, above "un" and "tuku", from the first line of the obverse on the top edge of the tablet. These signs read as follows:
[. . .] <x>? <*li/tu>? '' <x>? <x>?

Note: the content of the beginning of this tablet bears a very strong resemblance to the Balag E Turgin Niginam as it is preserved in the OB source BM 88288 (CT 42, 8)

1': [x x x x] <*mu>-<*na> <*DU>-<*ra>? <*DU>?-<*ra>
  Note: the "ra" and "DU" before the final "ra" in the line are only preserved in very slight traces that can belong to numerous different signs, but since thet are position exactly above "ra" and "DU" in the corresponding signs in the next line and have exactly the same width, it seems likely that they are also "ra" and "DU".

  Note: the sign read as "GIŠ" looks a little too narrow to be "e₂", especially when compared with the other "e₂" in the line, but since "e₂" is written without verticals on the tablet, both "GIŠ" and "e¬₂" are possible.

N.S.: ša₃, mu-lu and w.u. nu- and -bi
T: 3 S, 2 + 2 w.u. N.S.; 5 + 2 w.u.

-------- *double dividing line with 10-mark --------
10': *eŋ₃ *ni-*zu *e₂-*gi *bi-*a *eŋ₃ *ni-*zu *e₂-*gi *bi-*a
  Note: in the two signs read as "e₂" in this line there is possibly a slight trace of a horizontal wedge near the top of the middle of the sign, but since "ma" throughout the tablet has a clear horizontal wedge closer to the middle of the line, "e₂" seems more likely. Note, however, with the corresponding sign in the next line there does seem to be a trace of a (slightly) clearer horizontal wedge near the middle of the line.

12': *egi₂! *ga-*ša-*an-*e₂-<*an>-<*na>? <*eŋ₃> <*ni>-<*zu> <*e₂>-<*gi> *bi-*a
  Note: with the signs between "na" and "bi-a" only traces of the top wedges are visible, but since they seem to be the same width as the signs in the previous line, it is probable that they are the same. Note also, with the sign at the beginning of the line the second part of the sign is clear and corresponds to "NIN" and though the two surviving Winkelhaken of "MI₂", for the first part of the sign, are faint, it is clear from their placement that they belong to the sign and that "NIN/egi₂" was intended.

VAT 1509 (VS 2, 69):
See Cavigneaux JAOS 113: 254, who cites some of the lines in this source. It is very unlikely, on thematic grounds, that this tablet belongs to the same tablet as VAT 1472, which contains a lament to Inana. It is, however, very possible that this tablet belongs to the same tablet as VAT 1557, one of the sources with the Ershemma {d}utu e₃-ma-ra, duplicated in L.1486, VAT 1323+, etc. The most direct evidence for this is that both this tablet and VAT 1557 have lines that duplicate lines in VAT 1323+. Note also that there is nothing on the basis of the ductus, format, and size of the two pieces that would rule out them belonging to the same tablet, eith. If the two pieces belong together (and it seems likely that they do), then VAT 1557 contains the beginning of the obverse and this source continues after the break with the second part of the obverse before breaking off again.

7) VAT 1533 (VS 2, 85): this piece is is stored in the same box with VAT 1509 and VAT 1472, but it is unlikely that it belongs to the same tablet as either of the two pieces. Thematically, the tablet seems to contain a Dumuzi-Inana lament, which rules out the connection with VAT 1509, which is a lament to Utu, and although VAT 1472 also seems to contain a Dumuzi-Inana lament, the preserved sections of that tablet are from a first person lament, whereas all of the preserved sources in this tablet have finite, 3rd person verbal forms. Furthermore, while the ductus of the two tablets is similar (in particular the characteristic way "sa" and other signs are written), the shape of the two tablets is different, and on physical grounds alone, it seems unlikely that they belong to the same tablet.

  Note: there are slight traces of what appears to be a wedge following the break at the beginning of the second part of the line which may belong to a sign. Since, however, there are no traces of a dividing line between the first part of the line and this line, it does seem probably that the signs in this line belong to the second part of the preceding line. Note also that it is unclear whether the traces following "an-na" in the first part of the line belong to one or to two signs. If two signs one possibility would be "kur-ra", especially since the preserved part of the end of the sign looks a lot like either "ra" or "la" and there is very little space for a sign much larger than"kur" in the space preceding it.

  Note: the last three signs in the line are written well into the reverse of the tablet and that the sign between the first "ga" and "DU", which has a break through most of the sign, must have been very small; "ga" and "na" are reasonable guesses, but both are far from certain.

Note also that it is unlikely (but not completely impossible) that the sign read as "u₃" is "hul", since the sign is much narrower than "hul" in the previous line and the box-part of the sign looks more like that of "u₃" than like the "UR" at the end of "hul".
rest of reverse broken: note though that in the space after l.11' of the reverse there are the signs that have carried on to reverse from l.1' of the obverse making it impossible to determine how and whether the text continued on the reverse.

The side identified as the obverse was identified as such due to the presence of at least two lines that continue on to the reverse of the tablet. Note, however, against this possibility, the possible occurrence of a single dividing line after the last line on the bottom edge of the tablet which may indicate that the lines before it are from the reverse and not from the obverse.

Note also, however, that in the writing of Nanna as "ŠEŠ.KI", the "ki" sign seems to have only two horizontals, so it is possible that "ki" was sometime also written cursively.

Note also that the head of the last sign in the line appears to be uninscribed, making it possible that this is "bi" instead of "ga" (note, however, at the end of the next line the sign is clearly "ga").

VAT 1370 (top right corner of a tablet assumed to belong to same tablet as VAT 604, with which it does not physically join). The ductus indicates that it definitely belongs to one of the multi-column tablets in the ka-ša-an group, but it will be left open whether it belongs to VAT 604+.

  Note: the inside of the top of the sign read as "še₃" is broken making it impossible to determine whether there were more than the two preserved horizontal wedges inside the sign, but it seems likely that there were, and the box around the sign seems too narrow to be "tug₂". Note also that the horizontal with the last sign is at the same height with respect to the preceding vertical as with "me" in the preceding line and even lower than with "me" at the end of l.9.

end of reverse of fragment

(Note: if this fragment really does belong to the same tablet as VAT 604, then there cannot be many missing lines between where the main part of column ii ends and the lines on this fragment begin, judging from the way the tablet edge tapers when lined up with the tablet edge of the main piece of the tablet).

2: *e-*ri *ab-*ba-gi-en ni-ba ri-a-ta

  Note: since "zu" seems to lack a top vertical wedge throughout the tablet, it is possible that the sign read as "ba" in this line and l.5 is "zu" and the pair of signs is to be read "ab-zu". 

S: e-ri for uru, ab-ba for a-ab-ba, ni for ni₂ and w.u. gi-en for -gin₇

3: zu-en *igi *da-*ŋal₂ e-si u₃-ri-*ma
  Note: that throughout the tablet the signs "ma", "ba", and "zu" are sometime difficult to distinguish from one another. This is particularly true of "ma" and "ba", but with "zu", there are some instances (especially in col. iii of the reverse) where a clear top vertical wedge is added to "zu", but this appears not to have been done consistently as the "zu" signs in these first few lines, which have no top vertical, demonstrate. With "ba" and "ma", sometimes the bottom wedge of "ba" is slightly diagonal, as it is with "ba" after "ni" in the previous line, and often "ma" is written with a longer, straighter horizontal wedge at the bottom of the sign, but these distinguishing features do not seem to have been added consistently to distinguish "ba" from "ma".

S: zu-en for {d}suen, da-ŋal₂ for daŋal, e-si for ensi₂, and u₃-ri-ma for urim{ki}-ma, as well as the omission of the determinative {d} and {ki}

&&VAT 613 (VS 2, 4, obv. 21f.), possibly joins VAT 1335 and VAT 1349, which are kept in the same box with this tablet.

"Ershemma no.34.1"

Obv.
col. i
Note: the traces of the first twelve transliterated lines are all from VAT 1335 (labeled here A₁), a piece of a multi-column tablet which does not seem to physically join VAT 613 and which may not belong to the same tablet. Note, however, that the ductus of the two pieces is very similar, and the two pieces could very well have been written by the same scribe. If the two pieces do join, however, then the entire tablet, when the pieces are physically in contact and the columns are aligned, would have been 180+ mm in height and 97+ mm in width, and since there were at least three columns on the reverse of VAT 1335, then this would have been at least a six-column tablet. Col. i of A₁ reads as follows:

  Note: the last two signs seem too box-like to be "zu" and "lu/ku" seems more likely. Note also that the last sign in l.6' has a clear vertical wedge, making it likely that this sign is also "LU" instead of "KU". It should be noted, however, that the signs read as "lu" and "zu" are virtually identical, so either the two signs were not clearly differentiated or they are both either lu or zu.

  Note: "la" is possible, but far from certain - it is possible, for example, that this is "la" preceded by another sign, or a more complex sign like ama or da; however, in the previous line the traces of the sign before "gi" look a lot more like "la" than "še₃".

  Note: it is possible that the fifth sign is "lu", but the bottom horizontal wedge seems too diagonal to be "lu", and "zu" is probably more likely. Note, however, that this sign and the sign read as "zu" near the end of the next line both have a small vertical wedge through the middle of the top wedge of the sign.

  Note: throughout the tablet "e₂" and "ŋiš" are virtually indistinguishable, making it difficult to determine which one was intended. In the previous line, however, the ŋiš/e₂ sign seems to have an extra horizontal wedge inside it, possible serving as an indication that the intended sign is "e₂" and that all the defective writings of the sign that follow are also "e₂".

  Note: it is uncertain whether the second sign, which only seems to have two horizontal wedges, is "DI" or "KI", and given the number of defective writings of "KI" in these texts, either is possible. In favor of "KI" note also that the bottom horizontal wedge goes through the bottom wedge and is not directly inside the sign, like it typically is with "DI".

1: *u₃-*e *ku-*ku *lum-*ma *kur-*ra <*mi/lum>? <*di>-*ri-*la *di / *ri *ba-*ra-*KA
  Note: since the top half of the sign is broken it is not possible to determine whether the sign after "kur-ra" is "mi" or "lum", but on the basis of the traces, both are possible.

  Note: it is possible that the first sign in the indented line is "ba", but the sign looks more narrow and box-like, like "KU". Note also, it is possible that there are two signs at the end of the indented line instead of "saŋ", and that these signs are "si-<DU>?" or the like.

  Note: there is a single diagonal wedge inside the fourth sign near the bottom vertical wedge of the sign, and given the placement of this wedge it is difficult to determine whether the sign is "a₂", "da", or "UŠ", though one of these seems likely. Note also that this is definitely the third line on the tablet.

  Note: there does seem to be an additional vertical wedge inside the sign read as "lu", but since none of the signs read as "ku" in the corresponding phrase in l.1 seem to have this vertical wedge it is possible that this sign is also "ku" (or that all of these signs are "lu" and all but this one are defectively written).

Sjoeberg MG 100 reconstructs this line based on CT 15, 17: 17, which reads: e i-i lugal-ra u₄-de₃-eš-e mu-un-e₃, but the signs in this line are so different that I don't see how that is possible, even if the first half of the line (when restored from l.22) is identical.

The occurrence of PAD₃ throughout the source for pa₃, sometimes interchangeably with pa, may be a diagnostic feature of sources from this group.

  Note: the sign read as "a₂" seems to have more wedges than the following "da" and the sign read as "ke₄" looks simpler and more defective than "ke₄" in the preceding line (see collation drawing for drawings of these signs), so it is possible, though not completely certain, that these signs are "a₂-gur" instead of "da-ke₄".

  Note: the second sign read as "zu" probably has another vertical wedge at the top of the sign, but it is very faint, and it is possible that this is another sign, like "ba"; also, the sign read as "še₃" does in fact have a longer bottom horizontal wedge like "šu", but it seems to have three more horizontal wedges closer to the top of the sign than "šu", which typically has only two more horizontal wedges on this tablet (cf. "šu" in the next line, for example), making it more likely (though not certain) that this sign is "še₃".

  Note: see collation drawings for last two signs in the first part of the line: the second to last sign is probably "uš", but could be a poorly written "DU" and the last sign, which is partially broken at the end of the sign, is probably "ra", but could also be "e".

  Note: three small flakes have broken off the tablet toward the middle of this line, breaking all the signs between "zu" and "HE" down the middle. While enough of these signs survive that the reading of all but one of them is certain; however, there are not enough remaining traces of the sign read as "še₃/šu" to determine with certainty which of these two signs was intended (note, though, the top of the sign, which is better preserved, is narrow like "še₃" typically is on this tablet).

  Note: there is a small break after the beginning of the sign read as "am", and since the preserved part of the sign is consistent with "ne" and "eden" if the last part of the sign is indeed broken then "NE" or "eden" are likely. But it is really difficult to determine whether there really were wedges in the break.

 Note: the sign read as "su" has two horizontal wedges inside the sign, unlike "šu" on the obverse which only has one; also the sign has a different Gestalt than the other "su" signs on the tablet where, when they are written with two horizontals, these horizontals are smaller and closer to the vertical wedge at the end of the sign.

  Note: the fourth sign in the line has a vertical at the top of the sign, making it unlikely that it is "ba". Similarly, the sign before the second break seems too wide to be "ba" and is probably "ma". The traces of the sign before the first break suggest a sign like "ba", but this is not completely certain. Note the sign before the break at the end of the line is narrower than "ma" at the beginning of l.4, but it is possible that it is "ma" instead of "ba" (the same holds true for the sign near the end of the next line).

This possibility seems less likely, however, in the next line where "ŠI" and "BA" are separated more on the tablet. Note also that the sign after "ki-ki-NE" in this line and the next lacks the top vertical that would make it a clear "zu".

3) = C: BM 87518 (CT 42, 15) = col. ii l.8f. (beginning of a kirugu of a composition whose incipit is almost completely broken, but which seems to be different than the incipit of source B)

side i	
1: *i-*ni-*ma-*ni *i-*lu *i-*<lu>? [. . .]
Note: only a trace of the very beginning of the second "lu" is preserved, and since there is a break of 4-5 signs until the end of the line it is possible that the sign is "ni" and the rest of the line is to be reconstructed i-ni-ma-ni i-lu.
  B (col. ii. l.1): *e-*ne-*eŋ₃-<*ŋa₂>-<*ni> *i-*lu *i-*lu
  C (col. ii. l.8): e-ne-eŋ₃-ŋa₂-ni i-lu i-lu u₃ am KU/MA i-lu
2: <*e>?-*ni *mu-*li-*la *i-*lu *i-*lu
Note: It is also possible that the sign read as "e" is "i", but the traces of the sign are very faint and seem to more closely resemble "e". However, "i" is also possible. The same observation applies equally to the "i/e" at the beginning of the next line. A point that would speak against "e" here is the clear writing of "i" with "i-ni" in lines 5-6. Note also that there is an uninscribed space for around 3 signs after i-lu until the end of the line in this line and the next.
  B (ii. l.3): e-ne-eŋ₃ {d}mu-ul-lil₂-la₂ i-lu i-lu

  C (ii. l.13): e-ne-eŋ₃ ki-gin₇ sig₃-ga-na i-lu i-lu
4: *i-*ni-*ŋa₂-*ni *i-*lu *ka-*na-*ŋa₂-*ka <*šu>? / *ku-*u₄-*ku-<*x>-*ra
Note: that the sign read as "ŋa₂" is much wider than "ma" in l.1 and does not have a horizontal wedge inside it, indicating that it is definitely not "ma" and that it is probably "ŋa₂". It is possible that the sign read as "šu" is "ši" or another sign entirely. There is definitely another "ku" after "u₄" followed by either one wide sign or two signs of which the small is very narrow and consists only of two to three small wedges. It is possible that the sign is "gu", but if that is the case it is very poorly and incorrectly drawn. "ši-gi-ra" is possible for these signs, but would be a bit of a stretch. 
  B (ii. l.4): <*e>-<*ne>-*eŋ₃-*ŋa₂-<*ni> *i-*lu *kalam-*ma-*ka *šu *kur-*kur-*ra-*ka

5: *i-*ni *mu-*li-<*la> *i-*lu *ka-*ŋa₂-*ka <*KU/LU> <ki/ša₃/ku₃>?-<ga>?

  B: the rest of col. ii differs from the text of YBC 16392
  C: rest of col. ii differs from both YBC 16392 and source B
7: <u₄>-*gin₇ *mu-ul?-<lil₂>?-*a *gal-<la>? *hu-*lu-*a / *si-*gi-ta-*a
Note: it is possible that the last wedges of "mu" contain the Winkelhaken of the next sign which could then be read "ul", but this looks unlikely (though not impossible).
8: *a-*sa-*li-*la <*ši>? *hu-<bi>?-<x> lu/si-ga/ig *hu-*lu-*a / si? *gi-<*ta>-*a
Note: the sign read as "mu" here does not really look anything like "mu" and looks more like "sa" or another sign that begins with two or three horizontal wedges and does not end with Winkelhaken or a vertical wedge. Note also that the sign looks nearly identical to the "sa" in the next line. For the rest of the signs in this line see collation drawing. There is possibly another horizontal wedge before the sign read as "si" in this line, but this is difficult to determine with certainty.
9: *i-*ni-*ka-*ni *sa *u₂ <*UD/KI>? *gi-<gi>?-*ra-*a / *u₂-*ri-*ka-*ni <x> 
10: *i-*ni *mu-*li-*la *u₂-*ma *hu! *a-*ra-*a / u₂-ri-ka-ni <ka>?
There is space for one sign after "ni" at the end of the line. Note also that the sign read as "hu" looks a little like "ri", but given that the "hu" in the next line is certain, this is almost certainly a poorly written "hu".
11: *i-*ni *a-*gu-*la *u₂-*ma <*hu> *a-*ra-*a <x>? 
Note that the second part of the line "u₂-ri-ka-ni" is not written in this line, although if there are traces of a sign at the end of the line this sign may be the beginning of this sequence (or may indicate its absence). 
12: <*si>-*gi-*da <x> <bi>? *ta <*DU> *ka <*ni>? / *u₂-*ri-*ka-<ni> / [. . .] na-ti 
Note: it is possible, though not certain, that there are traces of a sign after "ka" at the end of the first part of the line which may belong to "ni".
13: du?-mu? *ma-*da *<a>-*a <ra/u₂>? [. . .] <x> <*ka> <x> <x>? / traces of signs? <x> <x>
Note: there is space for about two signs after "ra/u₂" and there seem to be traces of two signs before "na-ti" at the end of the first part of the line. It is possible that the sign read as "ti" belongs to the end of the second half of the previous line, but the aligment of the sign suggests that it belongs to the end of the first part of this line instead. Note also that there is space for about 2 signs in the break before "KA" in the second part of the line.
Second note: the alignment of lines in this line and the end of the preceding lines is very difficult: u₂-ri-ka-ni at the end of the previous line is clear, but there are traces of two signs slightly beneath them that look like "na" and "ti" which either belong to the end of the first part of this line, or may belong to the end of the second part of the previous line, or may belong to an Akkadian gloss. If the first possibility is the case then "na" can't be part of the line since it is written under "KA" and may thus be illusionary. Against the second possibility is the presence of additional signs under "KA-x" which would suggest that "KA-x" belongs to the end of the first part of this line and there is a second part of the line beneath it, or it may indicate that there is an Akkadian gloss under the second part of this line (which would then contain the signs "KA-x". See drawing on collation sheet for the difficulties here.
Note: the triple line at the very end of the prism does very much suggest that l.12 is a triple line with the third part of the line containing "na-ti". This would mean that "KA" "x" belongs to the end of the first part of l.13 and that the unreadable traces beneath these signs belong to the second part of the line.
14: du-*ra *a-e/zu? ra/al?-*du-*a [. . .] traces <mu>? <ni>? <ŋar>? <x>? / [. . .] <ta>? <gi>? <x>?
Note: there is space for two or three signs in break before "mu" and "ni" at the end of the first part of the line and space for two or three signs in break before traces at the end of the second part of the line.
15: *mu-*le-*el *ši-*ig-*na-<*ŋa₂>? traces <x> *a / *u₂?-*ri an/na? gi?-<na>?-*a
Note that there are traces of one or two signs under the end of the second half of the line which are either the continuation of the line or belong to glosses. In any case, this would raise an additional possibility for the misaligned signs in lines 12-13.
16: u₂?-*lu-*la-*a *KU.*KU *DU-<*ra> <x> [. . .] *ri <ka>?
Note: It is possible that the sign at the beginning of the line is "i" instead of "u₂", but u₂ is more likely. There is space for one and at the most two signs in the break before "ri" and the "ka" at the end of the line is far from certain, though there are traces of another sign here.
17: *am-*ri-*ni *DI-a *du-*ra a? <ur₅>?-<ri>  [. . .]
Note: there is space for one sign at the end of the line. 
18: e?-*le-*el *me-*<en> *lu mu/gi <x> <x> <x> <x> / traces
19: *KU *na <bi>? <gi>? <ra>? <la>? <me>?-*en *KU [. . .] <x> <x> <x>
20: a?-*ab traces [. . .]
Note: there appear to be traces of signs beneath this line that either belong to another line of to the second half of this line. 
21: <x> *du <x>? du? NE/eden? <du>? <x> [. . .] / *e *mu-*na-ta? <an/ri>? [. . .]
Note: the beginning of this line appears to have been completely miscopied by Cohen. Note also that this line is written on the bottom edge of the prism.

side ii
1: <3-4 signs> <lu/ke₄/un>? *a-*i-*a <*mu> [. . .] / du-ra <e₂/ma>? [. . .]
2: <ra>? <*ka>? *gi *gi₄/ig-*<le>-*el <*ma>? [. . .] / si? <si>? <*gi> [. . .]
Possible that the signs read as "si-si" are one sign that is possibly "KA" or "KAxA". Note also that the sign before "le" and "el" (which are certain) is "mu" or "nam" if it is not "gi₄" or "ig" - the only thing speaking against "mu" is what appear to be 3 Winkelhaken at the end of the sign where "mu" in this source always only has two.
3: <LU>? *u₄ gu/mu-<mu/nam> *si-*si <x> [. . .] <*mu> [. . .] / *uru₂? *nam <mu> [. . .]
Note that the first sign read as "mu" has two Winkelhaken above the horizontal wedge at the beginning of the sign and only one beneath it, suggesting that it might be "gu" and the wedges above the horizontal at the beginning of the second "mu" may be two small verticals instead of Winkelhaken, making it possible that the sign is "nam" - either way the sign differs from the preceding sign. Also the sign read as "ša" by Cohen is almost certainly not "ša" and must be either "ta" or "uru₂".
4: *ki-*iš-*ki-*in *AN.<MUŠ₃/RI>-e? *la <gi/nam>? [. . .] / *uru₂-*ŋu₁₀ *mu-*ra <x> [. . .]
It is difficult to determine whether the sign after "AN" is "MUŠ₃" or "RI", but due to the placement of the Winkelhaken before the second vertical, MUŠ₃ seems more likely. The next sign looks more like "e" but it could be another boxed-shaped sign like "si" or "lu". The sign read as "uru₂" is identical to the sign read as "uru₂" in the preceding line and at the beginning of the following two lines.
5: *uru₂ KU/e? *ŋa₂-*ra <*NIG₂>? nu/na?-*mu-*da-*ŋa₂ (or: <al>) [. . .] / *a-*ku/ma-*ra *mu <ŋa₂>? [. . .] 
Note: the box-like sign after uru₂ could be "KU" but there seems to be more than just one horizontal inside the sign making it more likely that it is "e" or "lu". The sign read as "nu" is probably "nu", but there is at least a possibility that it is a tightly squeezed "na". The same ambiguity also applies to the next line where the middle of the sign is broken by a crack in the prism. It is very difficult to determine whether the sign read as "ku" in this line and the next is "ku" or "ma".
6: *uru₂ *KU nir?(or: KAL/KE₄) *ŋa₂-*ra *a <nu/na>?-*mu-*da-*al [. . .] / a-ku-ra mu-<da/ma>? [. . .] 
7: *e-*le-*el <*me> <en/nun>? [1-2 signs] <i>?-<da/ma>? <*ni> [. . .] / [. . .] <*mu>? [. . .]
8: <e>? *na-*am-*ta-<*ra> [. . .] / *[. . .]
9: *ku-*ru-*du *ku-*ru [. . .] / [. . .]
10: *{d}*inana *zi-*ŋu₁₀ <*nu>-<*uš> [. . .] / *a <i>? [. . .]
Note: "ra" is really unlikely for the sign after "a".
11: <UD/e>? KU/MA? *an-*šu-*ra-<*ra>? u₃/mi? <x> [. . .] / *a *i-*si <ma>? [. . .]
Note: it is possible that the sign read as "u₃" at the end of the first part of line is "mi" due to the resemblance this sign shares to the sign at the end of the first part of the next line which looks more like "mi" than "u₃".
12: <x> *da a pa-aš₂ <mi>? [. . .] / [. . .] *a *i-*si *ma [. . .]
13: [. . .] <x> <lu/e>? <ta>? *{d}*ba-*u₂? <mi>? [. . .] / [. . .] <a>? <*i>-*si <ma>? [. . .]
Note: it is unclear whether the traces of signs under the first part of the line belong to the second part of the line or to another line entirely - but the presence of a sign that looks like "si" would suggest the former possibility.
14: [. . .] unreadable traces of 3-4 signs near the end of the line [. . .]
Bottom edge of prism is eroded under this line, but it seems improbable that there was another line inscribed here.

side iii entirely broken

side iv
1: [. . .] <u₄>? ma/lu? <na>? ma/KU? *da <*gi>-<en>?

3: [. . .] <i/gal>? *ni-*ŋar-*ni-*ŋar-*ta
4: [. . .] *da-*gi-<da>?-*gi-*en */ *si-*ri-ši/na?-*da */ *en
Note: it is possible that the sign after the first "gi" is "da", but the traces would also support reading this as two signs: "im"? and "na" or the like.

Note that the surface of this tablet is very worn on both sides, making it very difficult to read many of the signs, particularly at the beginnings of the lines. I've added many of the collations noted on the collation drawings, but not that the pages for this tablet are filled with drawings and notes and should be consulted to resolves additional and remaining uncertainties.

  Note: in this and the following lines it is not entirely certain whether the sign read as "a₂" is "a₂" or "uru₂", though the number of wedges on the inside of the sign point more toward "a₂" - see collation drawings for examples of this sign.

11: <a₂> <e> <uru₂> *i₃!-še-še *i₃!(-)*ba-*su-*ku-*ta-*zu
  Note: In this and the following lines the first three signs are all identical, but it is difficult to determine whether the first is "a₂" or "da" (the sign seems to have one less wedge on the inside of it than the sign read as "a₂" in the first few lines, possibly indicating that this sign is "da"), and it is also difficult to determine whether the next sign is "e" or "KAL". It does, however, seem reasonably certain that the third sign in this sequence is "KE₄". Note also that the signs read as "NI" do not seem to have any vertical wedges inside them.

Woe, the weeping house and city, which you raised high.

12: a₂ e uru₂-*u₂ *i-*ru-*zu *am₃!-*ra-*i-*ru-*zu
  Note: throughout this tablet "AN" is frequently written in a way that makes it look a lot like "TAR"; usually, in these instances, though, there is a small vertical at the top of the sign, indicating that the sign is "AN" and not "TAR" - in the case of this sign, however, it is unclear whether this vertical is present, making it possible, though not certain, that the sign here is "tar". In the next line, this vertical is clearly visible with "AN", even though the rest of the sign has the appearance of "tar".

Woe, your plundered house and city which have been plundered.

13: a₂ e uru₂-*u₂ *bu-*ur-*zu *ma-*na-*še-*še-*ta-*zu

Woe, your uprooted house and city, which have been ...

Woe, house, city, when you go to the house of the gods. 

15: a₂ e uru₂ *an *sig₃-*a *uš?-*še *uru₂?-a-zu
  Note that here the sign read as "AN" here looks more like the conventional writing of "AN", in contrast to the two instances above in which "AN" looks more like "TAR".

Woe, house, city, which shake the heavens ...

16: a₂ e uru₂ *ŠE₃ *AŠ in/BU?-ta?-LAGAB?.<LAGAB>?-*a-*zu
  Note that the two signs read as "LAGAB" appear to have nothing inside them, though it is also possible that this is a cursive writing of "KU.KU".

&&BM 23666 (CT 58, 16) = Source A
Long single column tablet; not same format as other syllabic duplicates. The right edge of the tablet is exceedingly worn, making it almost impossible to read the signs near the end of the lines.

Note: top edge of tablet seems to have "[. . .] MUŠ₃" written on it.

Obv.
1: [x x x] *en-*ki *mu *KA <*ga>? *GAM am₃-<me>-<en>-ki-*en
  Note: I've noted that the inside of the second "en" is broken, making it possible that there was a "DINGIR" inside the sign.

NOTE: the readings of the last two signs in the line are based on the copy, since the surface of the tablet has become too worn to reconstruct the signs that may have been there when the copy was made. Kramer (in CT 58) reads "as₃-sa₂" and translates this phrase "I alone".

  Note: the first "DU" is written in the usual way "DU" is written, but the second is written in the idiosyncratic way, with a second horizontal wedge near the bottom wedge of the sign, which makes it look more like "da", as is found in some of the other tablets from this group.

NOTE: the meaning of "dim₃" is uncertain, but its occurrence in the temple name e₂-dim₃-ma suggests that it is a part of a temple or a type of shrine. For a discussion of this lexeme see SKL 83-84. The reconstruction of ki-sikil at the beginning of this line is based on the frequent occurrence of ki-sikil sa₆-ga // ŋuruš sa₆-ga in these texts, but [(x)] <inim> sa₆-ga is also possible

NOTE: Alster interprets bu-uš as a phonetic writing of pad₃-de₃ based on the parallels with BM 88406 rev. 9-10 = BM 23666 rev.71-72 which has -pad₃-de₃ for -bu-us₂-se, but is very unclear, how beyond this parallel, bu-uš can be a writing for pad₃-de₃.

&&BM 80758 (CT 58, 8):
Middle fragment, probably from a multi-column tablet. Different format that the group of single column tablets written in a highly syllabic orthography.
See also the transliteration of BM 96692 (CT 58, 7), which duplicates part of this tablet, which includes a score of the overlapping lines. With the exception of the first five preserved lines, the remaining lines preserved on the obverse of BM 80758 duplicate BM 96692 obv. 16'-rev.1, at which point the lines on the obverse of BM 80758 break off, making it impossible to determine any further correspondences. The lines on the obverse of BM 80758 are included in the score of BM 96692, but since the preserved lines on the reverse do not seem to correspond to the preserved content of BM 80758, they are transliterated separately here:

  Note: all the signs from "la" on are on the tablet edge and the sign read as <x> is at the  beginning of the reverse of the tablet and is followed by a break making it difficult to determine whether it belongs to the end of the corresponding line on the reverse or to this line and whether any additional signs followed.

&&VAT 1372 (VS 2, 75), the bottom right corner of what is almost certainly a multi-column tablet with lines from the end of col. ii' of the obverse and col. iii' of the reverse. The script is small and the lines on the obverse continue on to the bottom edge of the tablet. Almost certainly a collective tablet containing hymnic liturgies to Nanna and Martu.

B: VAT 1415 (VS 2, 51): the middle of a single column tablet with a different ductus and more signs per line than VAT 1377. 
C: VAT 1377 (VS 10, 74): the bottom left corner of what is almost certainly a single column tablet, judging by the number of double lines on the obverse and reverse.

lines 3-4 and the following lines in col. i and much of col. ii are from the same litany of gods that is found in Elum Gusun and the OB parallel source U. For these lines see the score of this litany below.
col. i has lines 1-54[ of the litany (with only one line broken at end of column)

Obv. col. ii has the beginning of lines 56-87 of the litany, which are followed by traces of the first signs in approximately 10 more lines which may or may not belong to the same litany and then the rest of col ii is broken
All of the lines in columns i and ii are transliterated in the score of the litany and are not transcribed here

&&VAT 1378 (VS 2, 46): a middle fragment from what was probably a single column tablet with the same format and ductus as many of the other single column, syllabically written sources in this collection. But note, there seems to be a little blank space before the beginnings of lines 8'-9', suggesting that there may have been another column to the left of these lines, which would make this a multi-column tablet. If this is the case, then it is possible that what has been read as the obv.(?) below is actually the reverse col. iii, with the preserved part of col. iv next to it being uninscribed. 
Note the possibility that this source belongs to the Abu Habbah group

&&VAT 1380 (VS 2, 58), grotty, very overbaked surface fragment, with several flakes which have broken often the fragment completely containing the left edge of what was almost certainly a multi-column tablet. Note also that the copy contains signs that are no longer preserved on the tablet and which do not seem to be on any of the four small flakes that are in the box with the tablet. What is even stranger is that there is nothing on any of these fragments to suggest that the lines that have been transcribed as the obverse end with l.12' (the last line preserved on the largest piece in the box) or that any of these fragments have any lines from the reverse of this tablet. There do, however, seem to be traces of one or two signs on the left edge of the obverse of the fragment, which is odd, since there should be any signs on the left edge of the piece unless they are from lines written horizontally which were added at the end when the scribe no longer had any space on the main surface of the tablet. To avoid any mistakes only the main piece has been collated below and anything that is in the copy but not on the preserved fragments is enclosed in double-brackets, including all of the lines that were attributed by the copyist to the reverse, which do not seem to be on any of the pieces in the box.

&&VAT 1385 + VAT 1386 (VS 2, 30) - possibly belongs to the same tablet as VAT 1387 and VAT 1351, which were copied together with this tablet in VS 2, but since the pieces are not contiguous they are transliterated separately here.

&&VAT 1390 (VS 2, 88): tiny sliver from the right edge of what was probably a very thin multi-column tablet with numerous lines that continue on to the tablet edge. The piece is about the perfect width to belong to the upper corner of col. ii and iii of VAT 1351 and all of the other pieces of this tablet and it wouldn't surprise me if it does. If it does, it would contain the signs at the end of the bottom of col ii. and the top of col. iii. Also, not enough of the tablet is preserved to determine this with certainty, but it is possible that it belongs to the Abu Habbah group.

  Note: the last three signs and most of "u₈" are no longer preserved on the tablet, so they must have been reconstructed.
  B 4: *na-*aŋ₂ uru₂-ŋu₁₀-še₃ u₃ ga-am₃-du₁₁
  E 4: *na-*aŋ₂ *uru₂-*ŋu₁₀-<*še₃> <<b.s.>>

5: lu₂ eŋ₃-ŋu₁₀-a i-bi₂ bar-ra me-en
  A: *lu₂ *eŋ₃-*ŋu₁₀-*a '' *igi <*bar> [. . .]
  Note the traces of the sign after "ši" are not really visible at all.
  B 5: <*lu₂> *eŋ₃-*ŋu₁₀-*a *i-*bi₂ *ba-*ra me-en [(x) (x)]
  E 5: <*lu₂>? *a-*ŋu¬₁₀-<*a> <<b.s.>>
  Note: "lu" is possible on the basis of the preserved traces, but since the sign is largely broken the traces, and especially the width of the sign, seem equally to support "lu₂". Note also when the traces of this sign are compared with "lu" in l.33, on the bottom edge of the tablet, "lu₂" begins to seem even more certain.
Krecher see the writing a-ŋu₁₀ for eŋ₃-ŋu₁₀ as evidence that eŋ₃ 'thing', is to be read aŋ₂ and not eŋ₃.

One who looks after my things, I am.

6: nam-tar-ŋu₁₀-a ba-e-gub-ba me-en
  A: *nam-*tar-*ŋu₁₀-*a '' <*u₄>? [. . .]
  Note: there are no longer any traces of the sign read as "u₄".
  B 6: <*nam>-*tar-*u-*a *ba-*e-*gub-*ba *me [. . .]
NOTE: Krecher reads ud-e instead of ba-e, but ba is completely certain.
  E 6: *nam-*ta-<*ru>-*a <<b.s.>>
  Note: "ru" is nearly certain, and the sign is definitely not "ra" or "re".

One who stands by my fate, I am.

7: nam-tar gig gub-gub-ba me-en u₃-<<u₈ ga-am₃-du₁₁>>
  A: nam-*tar *+gi-*+gub-*+gub-<ba>? [. . .]
  Note: there are almost no traces of the sign read as "ba".
  B 7: <*nam>-*tar-*ra *gi-*e gub?-gub?-*ba me-en <*u₃> [. . .]
NOTE: it is not completely certain that the two signs between "e" and "ba" are gub-gub, but if they are gi-e-gub may be a sandhi writing for gig gub-gub-ba. Krecher's scepticism about "ŠI" at the end of the line not belonging to "u₃" is ungrounded, since the tablet breaks off right after ŠI making it possible (though of course not certain) that the end of u₃ followed.
  E 7: <*nam>-<*ta>? <x> <x> <<b.s.>>
  C (Obv. 7'): [. . .] <x> <gi>? <x> [. . .]
NOTE: it is possible that one of the two broken sign in C is "gi" or "tuku", but this is far from certain.

One who establishes a terrible fate, I am - I want to say woe!

8: dam an-tuku-a dam-ŋu₁₀ nu-me-en <<u₃-u₈ ga-am₃-du₁₁>>
  A: *dam *an-*tuku-<*tuku> [. . .]
  B 8: <da>?-ma-an-*du-*ka dam-ŋu₁₀ nu-me-en <x> [. . .]
Krecher reads the beginning of this source: dam-ma-an-du-du₁₁, but du-ka for tuku-a seems just as probable.
  E 8: <*dam> *[x]-*DU.*DU <<b.s.>>
  The break between "dam" and "DU" is large enough, but not much larger, than "an", and may have contained [A.AN].
  C (Obv. l.8'): [. . .] <x> i-bi₂ <x> [. . .]

One who has a spouse - you are not my spouse - I want to say woe!

  E 9: *dumu <*a>? [x (x)] DU <<b.s.>>
  Note: here the break is large enough for two signs, and if the traces of the first broken sign are from "a", which seems likely, then it is probable that "[<A>.AN.U₃?].DU" was in the break. 
  C (Obv. 9'): [. . .] <tu>?-*tu *dumu-*ŋu₁₀ [. . .]

  E 12: <*u₈>? <<b.s.>>
  Note: "u₈" seems unlikely on the basis of the preserved sources, unless it is a very poorly written "u₈".
Krecher plausibly reconstructs the verbal form (in source C) as mi₂--du₁₁ and suggests translating, "like a ewe tending to a foreign lamb", though it is not clear what the significance of this image would be, and the image of ewes and goats being separated from their lambs and kids is much more common in the laments.

NOTE: the scribe definitely wrote "bi" (with two horizontal wedges) followed by "ga" (with three horizontal wedges), suggesting that ga-bi was probably intended. Since the end of the following "KA" sign is broken, it is also possible, if not likely, that there was an "A" inscribed in the sign.

18: e₂-e e₂-bi e₂ nam-tar-re-da a-gin₇ mi-in-da-an-ku₄-[re-en]
NOTE: it is probable (as Krecher argues) that a-gin₇-mi-in-da-an-ku₄ [. . .] is a sandhi writing for im-da-an-. Note also that he reads the end of the verb -ku₄-re-en
  A: <*e₂>-*e *e₂-*bi <*+e₂> [. . .] 
NOTE: there is blank space following this line and preceding the next one, and since there is a dividing line at this point in the text in source E, it is probable that this line indicates the end of a section.

  From the alignment of the broken fragments containing the end of the lines on the bottom edge fragment, it is uncertain whether the traces of the signs read as "ŋal₂-e/lu" belong to the end of the first part of the line or the second; but give the parallels with source B the second half of the liine seems more likely.

  A: [x] <*ba>?-*ŋu₁₀ <x> [. . .]
  Note: "ba" is reasonably certain and there seem to be traces of the end of another sign which must have been small, judging from the size of the break. As Krecher notes, it is unlikely that the traces of the preceding sign belong to "igi". 
  B 22: [x]-ŋu₁₀ al-tar-tar-re al-ma-ma ŋa₂ mu-na-KU-e-en

BM 15793 col. ii 2: i-bi₂-ŋu₁₀ al-tar-re al-ma [. . .]
NOTE: since in nearly every occurrence of al-tar = 'work' the verb is "gub", this and the writing al-tar-tar in source B make it unlikely that "work" is meant here, but what else could have been intended here is equally uncertain. 

Before me work(?) is being done - I sit here(?) for him.

5 (27): bar-ŋu₁₀ al-tar-re al-ma-ma ŋa₂-e mu-na-KU-e-en
  A: <*bar!>-*ŋu₁₀ <*al>? [. . .]  
  Note: the sign at the beginning of the line looks a bit like "qa", or "bar" with a winkelhaken at the bottom of the sign. In light of the "bar" in source E, it therefore seems probable that this sign is "bar" written over another sign.
  B 23: [x (x)]-ŋu₁₀ al-tar-tar-re al-ma-ma ŋa₂ mu-na-KU-e-en

NOTE: Krecher rules out NE after bi₂-, but the photo has a very clear "NE" here. The sign after it is less certain, but "e" is possible. It is unlikely that there were any additional signs in the small break after "e" though, making it likely that the traces of the signs in the space below this line on the bottom edge belong to the end of this line.

NOTE: Krecher reads pel₂ as gibil, and noting another instance when gibil and ur₅ occur in parallelism (SKL 113f.), he argues that these phrases are to be translated "immer Neue" and "immer Gleiche". The phonetic writing "bi-la" for "NExPAP" in source E, rules out "gibil" completely, though, and requires that the sign be read "pel₂". Also, in the parallel cited by Krecher there is not a "ki" before NExPAP and ur₅, and there the verb is also "e" 'to speak'.

At that defiled place, at that place of debt, (the fate determined there) was placed in my lap.

  C: omits
  E 15: [x x] <x> <*e₂>? [(x)] <<b.s.>>
Note: there is a small break at the beginning of the tablet here, but since the average width of the lines in this part of the tablet is ca.5-6mm, and the break between the traces of the signs preserved in the previous line and the next preserved signs is approximately the same width it seems likely that only one line is completely broken here.

  Note: the possible traces of a sign in the middle of the line may belong to the sign after "ra" in the next line, though they seem to be written slightly too high above "ra" for this to be the case.
BM 15793 col. ii 33: *su?-<*bar>?-*ŋa₂ *bar-*ŋa₂ *mu-*ub-*be₂ *šu-*še₃ <<blank space>>
  NOTE: "su-bar" at the beginning of the line is very uncertain, though it is possible that the tablet has su?-bar <<ersasure of one sign>>-ŋa₂. Given the structure of the preceding line, however, what would be expected here is NOUN (body part) bar-ŋa₂ bar-ŋa₂ etc. For this reason, su-bar 'body' makes very little sense, especially in light of the bar-ŋa₂ which follows. Since there is space in the erased part of the tablet after the first sign for "bar", the question becomes what the sign at the beginning of the line (which is perfectly preserved on the tablet) might be.

NOTE: "zu" is not completely certain, but the bottom wedge seems to slant in way that suggests that it is more likely that this sign is "zu" than "ke₄". It is also possible that "ma" is to be read "a₂!". The broken sign before "da" is likely to be either "mu" or "im", but the traces are not decisive.
BM 15793 col. ii 35: *mu-*lu₂-<*zu>? *a₂-*ŋu₁₀ mu-da-ab-ha-lam-<ma>? [. . .]

Note also that the last sign at the end of this line and the next is too box-like to be "ba", but does not seem to have a vertical wedge in the middle of it, the way the corresponding sign does in the next line, suggesting that this sign is "KU" and the sign in the next line is "LU" and has a clear vertical wedge inside the top horizontal wedge of the sign making it nearly certain that it is "LU".

&&VAT 1421 (VS 10, 179)
Note: for the most part the tablet seems to be very poorly written with numerous erasures and incorrectly written signs and part of the obverse seems to have been intentionally defaced with the end of the stylus. Furthermore, some of the lines on the obverse continue on to the reverse of the tablet and do not stop at the tablet edge. It is therefore possible (though not certain) that this was a school exercise. Note also that due to the poor quality of the shape of the tablet and some of the signs and readings in the transliteration (of the obverse) below are uncertain.

Obv.
1: <ŋiš>-<*nu> *ŋi₆-*ŋu₁₀-*na-*ŋu₁₀ *a-*ši-*ir-*ra  <A>? / [(x) (x) (x)] *en-*še *im-*ra-*am-<*bi>? 
  Note: the sign at the beginning of the line is small and box-shaped, but all but the top of the sign is broken making it difficult to determine what it is and the following sign consists of two Winkelhaken with at least one vertical wedge below them, but if the sign is "mu" then it would have to be very squeezed as the second half of the sign would not be written at all (unless of course the Winkelhaken which has been interpreted as the beginning of "MI" in fact belongs to the end of this sign instead, which would then make the next sign "TUR" instead of "MI"). Note also that there are traces of the tops of two very small vertical wedges on the top right corner of the tablet at the end of the first part of the line, but it is possible that no sign was intended here. Note further, that it seems unlikely that there is another sign following the sign after "am" at the end of the second part of the line.
2: [x x (x)] <ya>? *al *mu-*ši-*ti-*ya *ša *ta-ni-*ha! / <ma>-lu-<u₂> / [. . .] <*ma>-*lu *ad *ma-*ti *ka-*le-*ku
  NOTE: CAD (under mušitu, lexical section, p.271) reads: "ŋiš-nu mi-mu-na-mu (Emesal for ŋi₆-u₃-na) a-ši-ir-ra si-a = <ina majjal> mušitiya ša taniha. The second half of the Akkadian line clearly has ad mati for adi mati = en-še (en-še₃) 'how long'. And under CAD kalu, lexical entry p.96: ŋiš-nu mi-mu-na-mu a-ši-ir-ra <x> en-še im-ra-am-x = "How long shall I be kept in the bed for the night which I fill with laments".
3: [. . .] <*mu>? *si *ama-*ŋu₁₀ <<*MU erased?>> / [. . .] <x> *si
  Note: it does seem likely that the last sign in the first part of the line was erased.
4: <x> <x> <x> [. . .] <x> <x> <x> 
  Note: it is unclear whether the traces of the signs at the beginning of this line belong to this line or the previous line and it is possible the traces of the signs at the end of this line belong to the end of the first part of the next line.
5: <*ga>?-<*ša>-*an <x> [. . .] / <*a>? <x> <x> [. . .]
6: *u₃-*šu-*ra *gi-<ŋu₁₀> [. . .] / *ama-*ŋu₁₀ <x>? [. . .]
  Note: it seems possible that the rest of the second half of the line after "ama-ŋu₁₀" was intentionally destroyed by the scribe.
7: *ši-*a-*tu *i-*ši-*ta-*pu-*ri <i>-<ta>-*ah-*da-*ra-*ni-*ni / <<erasure>> <*AMA> <*i>-*ta-<*ah>-*da-<*ra>-*ni
  Note: all of the signs at the end of the first half of the line from "muš" on continue on to the reverse of the tablet. 
8: *ma-*la-<ra> [x] <*gi>-*ŋu₁₀ *ama-*ŋu₁₀ *mu-*si-<*si> / *ama-*ŋu₁₀ *mu-*si-*si
  Note: the sign read as "si" at the end of the first part of the line is written on the reverse of the tablet and seems to be followed by at least one further vertical wedge, making it less likely that it is "si", unless it is "si" followed by another sign. Also, the second "si" sign at the end of the second part of the line seems to have another wedge inside it, but it is possible that this wedge belongs to a sign at the end of a line on the reverse which has continued on to the obverse. See the notes to rev. l.4 for the problems with this trace.
9: *ru-*a-<*tu> *i-*ši-*ta-*pu-*ri / *i-<*ta>-*ah-*da-*ra-*NI.*NI <*AMA> <*i>-*ta-*ah-*da-*ra-*ni
  Note: the entire second part of the line from "i" on is written on to the reverse of the tablet.
NOTE: CAD adaru, lexical entry, p.103 renders this line and the previous line: ma-la-ra gi-mu ama mu-mu-si ama-mu mu-si-si = "through their many messages (sent to me during my sickness) the girl friends (showed that they) were concerned about me, (my) mother was concerned about me".
10: <*ama>? *MU <*šeš>?-<*mu>? <*šu> <x>? *im-*mi-<si>?
Bottom edge:
11: <x>-*ta <i/da>? [x] *i-*ša-*at <x> [. . .] / [(x)] <x> *ta-<*ša>
  Note: throughout the tablet "ša" is distinguished from "ta" by the presence of horizontal wedges inside the beginning of the first part of the sign instead of vertical wedges, as with "ta".

2: *ki-*ša-*di *i-*ṣi(ZI)-*ṣi(ZI) *i- <*ta>-[na]- / *šu-*šu
  Note: for this pair of lines, see CAD kišadu (lexical section, p.446), which reads: <gu₂>-mu  gu₂! im-mi-si-[si] = ki-ša-di i-ṣis.ṣi i-ta-[na]-šu-šu: "my neck was caught(?) in a neckstock"

4: *ši-*ma-*ti-*ya *a-*lu *i-*ta-*ah-*da-*ar-<*ši> / *ama *i-*ta-*ah-*da-*ra-*ni
  Note: the sign read as "ši" at the end of the first part of the line consists of the same wedge that seems to intrude into the end of the second "si" at the end of l.8 of the obverse making it difficult to determine to which line this trace belongs or even whether it is in fact another sign. It is therefore possible that the first part of the line ends with "ar" and not with the sign read as "ši"? here.

6: *pi₂-<*iš>-ti *ma-*ta-*tu *i-*ta-*ah / *da-*ra *ama *ta-*ah-*da-*ra-*ni
  NOTE: see CAD under pištu = insult (lexical section, p.433), where this line and the preceding line are read: "e-mu (for in-mu?) kur-kur-ra bi-si ama-mu mu-si-si = pi-iš-ti matatu itahdara ummu <i>tahdaranni: 'the lands are concerned about my shame, (my) mother is concerned about me'.

--------------------

&&VAT 1432 (VS 2, 39) the bottom left corner of what is almost certainly a multi-column tablet. According to a tag in the box with the tablets, which appears to be confirmed by the format, ductus, sign size, and continuity of content, VAT 1432 and VAT 1443 belong to the same tablet. However, since VAT 1432 is about Inana and VAT 1443 is about Ninisina, it is unlikely that the two pieces belong to the same tablet. What is more likely is that the two sources were compiled by the same scribe as part of a series of laments. 
Note: both VAT 1432 and VAT 1443 have been attributed to the group of sources written in partially (as opposed to highly) syllabic orthography, a group which is closer to the group of source with isolated syllabic writings than the group with highly syllabic sources. However, the presence of writings with "ya" in VAT 1443 strongly suggests that the two sources should be grouped with the other phonetic sources containing laments.

2: [x] <*šu>-*ub-*ba *am-<*ma> *mu *zi-<*da> [. . .]
  Note: the sign read as "ma" has a different Gestalt than "šu" in the next line, and since it is wider and seems to have only three horizontal wedges, it seems much more likely that it is "ma" instead of "šu"; but since the corresponding sign in all of the following lines is "šu", the possibility should be kept open that this is a differently written "šu".

  Note: the sign read as "u₃" is relatively certain; since the sign seems to have been added after the clay had dried, like the signs in the next line, this may account for why some of the wedges at the bottom of the sign are not/no longer visible.
10': <AB>? <x> <*ri>? *ŋa₂? <x> [. . .]
  Note: the signs in this line and at the end of the previous line were clearly added after the clay of the tablet had dried, and since only a few of the wedges made it into the clay, it is difficult to determine with certainty which signs were intended. Note also that these two lines are probably from a catch-line.
end of column

-------------------

&&VAT 1434 (+) VAT 1435 (VS 2, 37): note this tablet is poorly formed and the signs seem to have been written in after the clay had already started to dry so that the wedges are not pressed deeply into the surface of the tablet, particularly near the bottom of the obverse and the top of the reverse.

Obv.
beginning of obverse broken
1': *ma-<*bi/NE>? [. . .]
  Note: With the first sign the bottom horizontal is longer than the top horizontal, but the single middle horizontal is shorter than the top horizontal and closer to the bottom horizontal, making "šu" possible, but "ma" more likely. Note also, that this sign looks nothing like "šu" in l.10' making it very unlikely that it is "šu". Since, however, the sign does not correspond exactly to the "ma" signs at the ends of lines 20'f., the possibility that this sign is "ba" should not be ruled out completely.
2': *u₃-*su [. . .]
  Note: "zu" is possible, but since there is not a trace of an upper vertical and the middle of the sign has two horizontal wedges, "su" seems more likely.
3': *u₃-*si <*bi>? [. . .]
4': *am *an <*zu>-<*bi> <*mu> <*x> [. . .]
  Note: "zu" is nearly certain, but since the middle of the sign is partially unclear, the possibility should be left open that there was only a single horizontal wedge and that this sign was "ba" instead.
5': *e-*zi-<*da>? *HI.<x> (OR: IM) [(x)] <*mu>? <x> [. . .]
  Note: there is a break after the beginning of the sign read as "da" where another piece has been joined to the tablet. While it looks like the join is seamless the fact that the beginning of "bi" in the line above in the same position is missing its beginning wedges makes it likely that there was at least a small break here - how large this break was is difficult to determine, but if it was small "da" is unlikely and if it was large "da" is possible.

  Note: only the beginning of the sign after "li" is preserved, but the beginning of the sign looks more like "li" than "in". The likelihood that this sign is "li" and not "in" becomes even clearer when the beginning of this sign is compared with "in" at the beginning of l.23 on the reverse, which has two clear rows of three Winkelhaken each (instead of two Winkelhaken each as with "LI" here) at the beginning of the sign.

Note also that in this line and the previous line the partially broken sign after "lu" looks too small to be "HUB₂?", but since the signs are squeezed in this part of both lines, it cannot be ruled out that this is the same sign as the corresponding sign in the previous lines.

Bergmann reads "amamaš₂ ku₃" and sees this as a phonetic writing for amaš ku₃.

-----------------

&&VAT 1443 (VS 2, 54) - for the possibility that this tablet belongs to the same tablet as VAT 1432, the bottom left corner of a multi-column tablet, see the notes to that source. While the two sources have nearly identical formats, ductus, and sign forms (compare in particulat the writings of "gi", "ta", and the writing of the sign "e₂" in an identical idiosyncratic way (see collation drawing for comparison), the clearest evidence against the two pieces belonging to the same tablet, is that VAT 1432 is clearly about Inana, and VAT 1443 is clearly about Ninisina. Since the two deities never occur together in the same laments, it seems very unlikely that they would occur in such close proximity within the same source. What does seem certain, however, is that the two sources were written by the same scribe, possibly as part of a series of laments.
Note: like VAT 1432 (VS 2, 39), this tablet has been attributed to the group of sources written in partially (as opposed to highly) syllabic orthography, a group which is closer to the group of source with isolated syllabic writings than the group with highly syllabic sources.

4': *{d}*a-*nun-*na *na/ki? *me *e₂-*gin₇ <x> [. . .]
  Note: the second half of the sign read as "ki" has numerous wedges and looks more like "ki" than "na", but since it also has a small horizontal wedge at the beginning of the left corner of the sign and the number of horizontal wedges in the second part of the sign seems to vary in each of the different "na" signs in this part of the tablet, it is probably more likely that it is "na" and not "ki". Note also that although it is possible that the sign before "gin₇" is "ŋa₂" instead of "e₂", in light of the clear "uru₂" before "gin₇" in the next line, "e₂" seems more likely. However, given the idiosyncratic way in which "ŋa₂" seems to be written in l.11', the possibility should still be left open that all three of these signs are "ŋa₂".
5': *uru₂-*a *lu₂ *uru₂-*gin₇ gi-le-<*eŋ₃>? [. . .]
  Note: the fourth sign is almost certainly "uru₂" and not "ŋa₂" (but see note to corresponding sign in previous line) and the sign after "le" could be the beginning of "eŋ₃", but not enough of the sign is preserved to determine this with certainty, and the traces could also support "en" or another sign entirely. 
6': *e₂-*nun-*na e₂/ŋa₂?-*gin₇ *ta-*ra <*x> [. . .]
  Note: there is enough space between "e₂" and "nun" for "a", but though the tablet is slightly worn in that space there are not any visible traces of "a" making it possible, if not likely, that "a" was omitted here. Note also, the fourth sign has the outer Gestalt of "ŋa₂", but does not seem to have any vertical wedges inside the sign and may be a very narrow, slightly elongated "e₂" or another sign like it, instead.

  Note: the traces of the sign before "mu" definitely do not support "AN" and look more like the end of "ŠE₃" or a similar box-shaped sign with a bottom horizontal wedge and a final vertical wedge. Not also that while "mu", "lil₂", and "la₂" are certain, the sign is either an erroneous "ul" or another sign, like "di", entirely. Note, though, if the sign after "a" in lines 8' and 10' is "ul", then "UL" is written in an unusual way in this tablet and the sign in this line may be the same idiosyncratic "ul".

On the basis of the shape of the sign, though, it has to be either "ba" or "zu".

&&VAT 1453 (VS 2, 44), top half of a long single column tablet which was probably originally over 22cm when it was complete. Note that the quality of many of the signs on the tablet is poor, suggesting that this tablet may have been produced as a school exercise by a scribe in training.

7: *ki *am-<*mu>? <*ki/di> *am *ub/ar₂ <*mu>? *u₃-*mu-<*un>-<*a>
  Note: the second sign in the line is definitely the same sign as the sign before "ub", and though the "un" near the end of the line is relatively certain, it is not completely certain.

9: [. . .] <x> <x> *HU *mu-*sa-*ar!-*sa-*re 
  Note: the sign after the first "sa" is definitely either "ri" or "ar", it is just difficult to determine whether the wedges before "ri" are stray or whether they are the beginning of "ŠI". However, unlike the "ri" at the end of the line, there are definitely wedges before "ri" in this sign, making it likely that it is "ar".

  Note: the sign before "mi" in the second half of the line seems much too wide to be "UR" and is wide enough to be "ama", but since much of the top part of the sign is broken, it is difficult to determine this with certainty.
  NOTE: this and some of the following lines are duplicated in BM 73137 rev. 1'f. as well as in BM 15795

  Note: the first sign in the line seems to have a few stray Winkelhaken inside it, making it look a little like "ka₂". Note also that the second of the three wedges of "KUR" seems to have been erased by the scribe, leaving a sign that looks a little like "gam".

&&VAT 1563 (VS 2, 90): the bottom edge of what was probably a single column tablet which may have had the same format and ductus as the other syllabically written single column tablets in the collection. Note: it is very difficult to determine whether the lines on the bottom of the tablet are from the continuation of the obverse or from the end of the reverse, making it possible that the side of the tablet that has been interpreted as the obverse is actually the beginning of the reverse.

It is also difficult to determine whether the traces of the following, unreadable, signs have also been erased or whether it only looks this way because of the current state of preservation of this part of the tablet.

&&VAT 1581 + 3545 + 3569 (VS 10, 174): top left corner of a single column tablet with the same format and ductus as the other syllabically written single column tablets in the collection. Note: this tablet is in the same box as VAT 3545 which may join to the bottom of this tablet. Note also that in VS 10, VAT 1581 is copied together with VAT 3545 and VAT 3569 as if all three pieces physically joined to form the top left corner of a single column tablet. However, since VAT 3569 has not been glued to VAT 1581 and was not in the same box as VAT 1581 and VAT 3545, it was not possible to verify this join. It will nonetheless be assumed that the pieces are all part of the same tablet.

  Note: this is the point on the tablet where VAT 1581 seems to join VAT 3545 making it very difficult to read the signs after su-ba. Note also that this line is followed by blank space on VAT 3545 making it look like the last line on the reverse. If the two pieces do in fact join, it is therefore necessary to assume that this is the reverse and not the obverse.

NOTE: this source was not originally identified as a phonetically written source, but the inclusion of the same numerical group of VAT sources containing phonetic writings, and the writing il for il₂ in l.4', and probably also [ba]-ra for bara₂ in l.1', suggest that this is a phonetically written source. The lines on the obverse are parallel to line in the Ershemma to Suen published in Sjoeberg MG p.44f., an Ershemma that is duplicated in BM 13930 and the first millennium source, SBH 38.

&&VAT 3574 (VS 10, 159): middle fragment from the right edge of what was probably a single column tablet, which nonetheless had a different format and ductus (the script on this tablet seems finer and more careful) than many of the other syllabically written single column tablets in the collection.

obv.
Note: it is possible that this is the reverse and not the obverse, but the curvature of the tablet suggests and the presence of lines that continue on to the other side of the tablet suggest that this is the obverse and not the reverse. Also the fact that many of the lines on the reverse are squeezed in to double lines also suggest that the scribe began to run out of space near the end of the tablet, supporting than this side is the obverse and the side with the squeezed signs is the reverse.

&&VAT 3578 (possibly unpublished?): a very unusual tablet with the ends of lines on the obverse(?) which are followed by a blank space on the tablet and then the beginnings of lines which continue on to the tablet edge and then on to the reverse of the tablet, which, with the exception of one sign with the correct orientation for the reverse, seems to contain only the ends of these lines from the obverse. Although it is possible that this piece is of the same type as many of the other syllabically written single column tablets in the collection, it is not clear why it has been assigned to the same tablets as VAT 3527 and VAT 3529, since these two pieces do not seem to possess the same idiosyncracies in line division.

  Note: the middle of the sign at the end of the first part of the line has been erased, making it impossible to determine how many horizontal wedges might have been inside the sign, making both "KU" and "še₃" possible; but in light of "KU" at the end of the next line, "KU" seems more likely. Note also that there are two small horizonal wedges next to "a" in the second part of the line which may have belonged to another sign over which "a" was written.

"Eden-na u₃-saŋ-ŋa₂-ke₄" (Alster's additional sources)

&&VAT 7032 (VS 2, 27): the bottom half of a six-column tablet containing a syllabically-written text written in a neat and nice ductus, unlike in some of the single column syllabically written sources which have a less careful script with numerous erasures and incorrectly written signs.

  Note: the first sign read as "zu" has no trace of a top vertical wedge and the exact same Gestalt as "ba" making it very difficult to determine whether the intended sign is "ba" or a defective "zu" (the same holds true for the sign after "ama" in the next line); however, since "zu" is very frequently written with the full cross throughout the tablet it seems more likely that the sign after "i-da" is "ba" and not "zu". Note also that the signs read as "zu-me" are "zu" written in the full form with a final vertical after the crossed wedges in the middle of the sign (the way it is usually written) followed by "AŠ". Note, lastly, that it is possible that there was another small sign after "KU" at the end of the first part of the line, but since there are no traces of one preserved on the tablet, it seems unlikely.

10': *gi *PA <*siki>? *na-*a-*mu *na-*mu-*gi-*ri(-)*da/a₂
  Note: since there is no dividing line between columns i and ii, it is not always easy to determine where the lines in col. i end and the lines in col. ii begin - for this reason it is possible that the "da" at the end of this lines belongs to the beginning of the adjacent line in col.  ii and not to the end of this line.

  Note: the first sign in the line is either "dam" or "nin₉", but "dam" seems more likely. Note also that there is a "KU" sign after "du₃" at the end of the first part of the line, which due to ambiguities in the where columns i and ii end and begin may belong to the end of this part of the line and not to the beginning of the adjacent line in col. ii.

Note also that the following sign definitely does not have any horizontal wedges inside it, but the possibility could still be left open that the sign is to be read "NI!".

  Note: the sign read as "da" looks a lot like "zu", but is probably "da".
9': *uru₂ *še-*eb *e *be₂-*li-*li-*še₃

14': *am₃ *gal *u₃-*mu-*un *ir₂-*ra / *am₃ *nu-*a-*ba
  Note: there is a sign before "am₃" that is either "da" or "a₂" and due to its placement could either be the first sign in this line or the last sign in the adjacent line, col. i, l.10'.
15': *KU *ša-*ab-*še₃ *saŋ *bi/gu₄ *RU-*da-*a-*ba
  Note: while it is possible that the sign "KU" belongs to the end of the adjacent line in col. i, l.12', its alignment really does strongly suggest that it belongs to the beginning of this line instead. Note also that the sign after "saŋ" has one vertical in the middle of it, just like the sign at the beginning of the next line and the sign read as "be₂" in col. ii, l.9' and after "u₃-mu-un" in the following line. Since "gu₄" would make sense here, though, it is possible that "gu₄" was intended, in spite of its similarlity with "bi" in col. ii, l.9'. Note lastly that "da" is written more fully here than it is in other instances in the tablet, making it look a little more like "ama" than "da", though that latter was almost certainly intended.

Note also that is not entirely clear whether the sign read as "du₃" at the end of the first part of the line had vertical wedges inside the sign, though there may be traces of three vertical wedges which would support reading this sign "ir" instead - against this possibility, however, note that the corresponding sign in the next line definitely does not have any vertical wedges inside the sign. Note lastly that the sign read as "ra/ab" is squeezed on the tablet edge making it possible that either sign was intended; in favor of "ra", however, is the fact that the first part of the sign is wider than the second part, which seems a little less likely for "ab".
5': *dam *ban₃-*da-*ŋu₁₀ *ur-*ra <*BI> *mu-*na-*du₃ / *ka-*aš-*bi *ha-*ma-<*ra/ri>?-*ri
  Note: the sign at the end of the first part of the line definitely does not have any vertical wedges, but if the corresponding sign in the previous line does have three horizontals it is possible that this sign is "ir" written defectively, possibly because the sign is squeezed and the scribe did not have enough space for them. Note also that the sign between "ma" and "ri" in the second part of the line is partially broken and eroded making it very difficult to determine whether this sign was "ra", "ri", or another sign entirely.
6': *ka-*aš-*bi *mu-*KAx<A>? *mu-*KAx<A>? *e₂?-*ta / *ul-*bi *hu-*mu-*KU-*mu
  Note: both of the "KA" signs have an inscribed sign inside them, but it is not possible to determine from the traces what this sign was or whether it was the same sign in both instances.
7': *ama-*ŋu¬₁₀ *nu-*ri-*ma!-<na!>? / *ama-*ŋu₁₀ *nu-*ri-*ma
  Note: while the sign at the end of the second part of the line is definitely "ma", the sign read as "ma" in the first part of the line looks a lot more like "da".
8': *KA *KU-*ra-*ŋu₁₀ *gam-*ma-*<na> / *ama-*ŋu₁₀ *nu-*ri-*ma
  Note: the sign after "KA" is definitely "KU".
9': *šu-*ŋu₁₀ *gi-*ga/bi *ŋir₃-*ŋu₁₀ *gi-*ga/bi / *ama-*ŋu₁₀ *nu-*ri-*ma
  Note: there are definitely two vertical wedges inside the sign read as "ga" at the end of the first part of the line and very probably also in the sign after the first "gi" in the line, possibly making it more likely that the intended sign is "ga" instead of "bi", since "bi" consistently has one or no vertical wedges throughout the tablet. 
10': *saŋ-*ta *al-*ta-<*la> *mu-*gi-*gi-<*ga/bi>? / *ama-*ŋu₁₀ *nu-*ri-*ma
  Note: at the end of the first part of col. ii, l.12' there is a "da" sign that either belongs to the end of that line or the beginning of this line; see note to that line for more details. Note also that it is very difficult to determine from the traces of the sign at the end of the first part of the line whether there were vertical wedges inside it.
-------------- *double dividing line on tablet ----------
11': *uru₂-*ta *BI/GU₄-*e-*ni *en-*ta / *ŋuruš(OR: lil₂!)-*ta! *im-*ša
  Note: the sign read as "ŋuruš" looks a little like the corresponding sign in the following line, but unlike that sign this one has ends with a sign that looks like "a" and not with a single vertical wedge. 
12': *a₂ *gur-*ra *amar-*ŋu₁₀ *AN *mu <*zi>-*da / *lil₂-*ta *im-*ša

col. iv
1: [. . .] <*bi/ga>?-<*mu>?-<*ni> *KU-*da *še/kur *NIN/u₃-<*mu>-<*na>? [. . .]
  Note: it is possible that the wedges that have been interpreted as the first "mu" sign in the line belong to "ni" and that the two signs together should be read "in" instead. Note also that the sign before "NIN/u₃" is definitely either "še" or "kur", but since only three of the Winkelhaken are clearly visible, it is difficult to determine (but not improbable) that there was a fourth wedge that would make the sign "še" instead of "kur". Note also that it is very difficult to determine whether the sign read as "u₃" in this line and lines 3 and 4 is "u₃" or "nin"; but since the beginning of the sign looks more like "MI₂" than "IGI", "nin" might be more probable.
2: [. . .] <*si>? *ri *DU-*ra-<*ŋu₁₀> [. . .] / [. . .] <*mu>-*gi-*na
  Note: since the beginnings of the lines at the beginning of this column are broken, it is difficult to determine whether the signs interpreted as the second part of this line are the second part of l.2 or whether they belong to another line entirely.

4: <*šu>-<*me>-<*si/še₃>? <*BI/GA>? <x> <*še₃>? *du-*ga *ši *NIN/u₃-*mu-*gi-*na
  Note: the sign at the beginning of the line could be either "ki" or "šu", but "šu" seems more probable. Note also that the sign read as "NIN" near the end of the line looks a lot more like "u₃" in this instance, but by contrast, the traces of the corresponding sign in the previous line look more like "NIN".

7: *za *mu-*lu₂!-*zu *u₄ *zal *e₂-*zu-*DU₃ / *nin-*ŋu₁₀-*da *mi-<*mi>-<*en>
  Note: it is possible that the sign after the first "mu" is a poorly written "mu", but "lu₂" seems more probable. Note also that the sign after "DU₃" does not have any vertical wedges inside it, but given the number of defective writings of "ni" on this and other tablets, "ni!" is certainly a possibility.
8: *ama *ugu-*zu *TUG₂-*zu *TUG₂ *šu-*bi *mu-<*uš/ta> *i₃-*ŋar-*ra [. . .]
  Note: since the top right corner of the sign read as "UŠ" is not legible on the tablet it is difficult to determine whether there was another edge here that would make the sign "ta" instead of "UŠ".
9: *ama *ugu-*zu *im-*me *šu *RI-*ŋa₂ *im-<*me>-*en *i-*gu-<*bi>
  Note: "šu" is written defectively in this line, with less horizontal wedges than the sign has in the preceding lines.
10: *šu-*ŋa₂ *uru₂-*e *sa *mu *HI *DU <*eŋ₃/NE>? [x (x)] <*mu>?-*KU-*gul
  Note: it is possible that the second to last sign in the line is "ba", but it seems too box-like to be "ba" and looks more like "KU"; note also that the traces of the preceding sign read as "mu" are also not completely certain.
11: *TU *ta-*a-*MU ŋal₅(*TE)-*la₂ *hul-*DU-*e <*nu>-<*mu>-*da-*du-*ru-*ne₂-*eš
12: *a *mu pad₃!(EL)-*da *AK *uru₂ *gi-<*si>?-<*ru> <x>? / *nu-*mu-*un-<*da>? [. . .]-<*ne>?-<*eš!>
  Note: there is definitely enough space in the break between "da" and "eš" in the second part of the line for "du-ru-ne(₂)".

17: *sig/ša₃!-*bi *a-*še-*er '' *nu-*bi-*li-<*da>-*<du>
  Note: it is possible that the sign read as "du" at the end of the line is another "da", but the traces suggest "DU". Note also that the "bi" signs in this line both have a single vertical wedge in the middle of the sign.
18: *e₂ *ir₂ *nu-<*ur/da> *ama-*ŋu₁₀ *in-*ti *ŋuruš *mu-*lu *u₃/KA-*mu/BI / *na-*DU/ab
  Note: the signs at the end of the line are very tightly squeezed and the sign after "KA/u₃" looks more like "mu", but could also be "bi" or "ga", though the sign before it looks more like "KA" than "u₃", and the very last sign in the line could be "DU", but looks more like "ab". Note also that the sign read as "e₂" at the beginning of this line and the next has only two vertical wedges, like "ŋa₂" in this source, unlike "e₂" in this source which typically seems to have three or more.  
19: *e₂ *a *u₃-*na *ma?-*za-*ga *nu-*ŋa₂ *ir₂ <*nu>? <*x> / *UR *ama *ugu-*ŋa₂-*še₃
  Note: the sign after "na" at the beginning of the line could be either "ma", "da", or "ama".

  Note: the sign after "dam" has the shape of "gaz", but could also be a poorly written "eŋ₃" or "mah".
3: *ama *e/ŋuruš *uru₂! *AN <*bi>? [. . .]
  Note: it is possible that the second sign in the line is "ŋuruš", but since there are several horizontals inside the beginning of the sign "e" may be more likely; also the only other plausible reading of the sign read as "uru₂" would be "ra" and "uru₂" seems more probable on the basis of the way the sign is written.
4: <*ama/a₂> *lil₂/gur *du₅-*mu *AN *mu?(OR: nu-<x>) [. . .]
  Note: the first two signs in the line could also be "a₂ gur", but "ama lil₂" seems more likely, especially since the first sign looks just like the first sign in the preceding line.

  Note: there are numerous difficulties in this line. These include - the sign after "i" could be "bi₂", but it would be a more simplified and schematic "NE" than the other "NE" signs on the tablet; the signs read as "GIŠ.MAN" could be a single sign such as "KIN!" instead of two separate signs; the last sign in the first part of the line is almost certainly "KA" with another inscribed sign and underneath it is a small "UR" sign that is either a gloss or a sign that was intended to follow it; the sign preceding the last sign in the first part of the line is almost certainly "da", but is less clear whether the two preceding signs are "KA" and "KA" with an inscribed sign, particularly for the first of these two signs, which seems to have too many vertical wedges in the second part of the sign to be "KA" with an inscribed sign; the second sign in the second part of the line is either a poorly written "AN" or another sign like "siki"; the sign or signs following the second "mu" in this part of the line are entirely uncertain, since they/it are/is written very small on the tablet - "bi-pad₃", however, seems unlikely; and following this sign or signs there is definitely an "a", which may be followed by a small "AN", if the sign belongs to this line and not to the beginning of the adjacent line in col. iv - if it does belong to this line, however, this would make it less likely that there is a "nu" before "nu₂" in the adjacent line and would leave a Winkelhaken at the end of this line/the beginning of the adjacent line unexplained.

Note also that is it possible that the signs read as "ni ši" are a single sign like "UŠ" or "gin₇", but the first "ši-ni/ir" seems more likely on the basis of the traces, especially since the sign read as "ni" has the same shape as "ni" in the next line; "tu", on the other hand, is relatively certain.

NOTE: the script seems a bit later and is probably either late-OB or early Kassite.

Obv.
1: *saŋ *dili-*ni *saŋ-<*e> [. . .] <*x> <*hi>?-*li **ni₂ *mu-<na>-<*SIG₇> / 
  *saŋ-<*huš!> <me>?-<*ni> <x> [(x)] <*e>-<*ri> *a-<*na>(possible, but not certain) *mu-*un-*keš₂-*da 
NOTE: <hi> is possible, but not certain. Note that as usual Cohen seems to have completely misread most of the difficult to read signs. "na" is possible but not certain. It is possible that the sign read as "huš" is "ki", but then it would be a poorly written "ki" and "huš" seems more likely. Between "ni" and "e" there are either one or two signs. If there are two "šu" and "ši" are possible, but not certain. Either way "LI" seems unlikely. At the third look "na" seems likely - "e" is very likely as well. It is possible that the sign before "e" in the second part of the line is "da" and that there are one or two partially signs before it and after the sign read as "me" - is it possible that these signs are "me-ri-še₃"? "še₃" would fit the traces of the second sign, but "ri" for the first one is a bit of the stretch (the first part of the sign is consistent with "ri" (more or less) but the second part of the sign doesn't correspond at all to "ri".

NOTE: it is possible that the signs read as ZA.A are a different sign, but ZA.A seems likely, and the first sign (ZA) is definitely not "ku₃". In the next line the corresponding sign is definitely "ku₃".

5: *u₄-*da *al-*diri(SI.A)-*a *mu-*da-*an-*de₂ *u₂!(TAB)-*ri-*li-<*na> <*al>-*e/SI *nu-*gi-*ga [(x)]
NOTE: it is difficult to determine with the sign after "al" is "SI" or "e" in this and the following line, though it is possible that there are traces of small horizontal wedges before the vertical in the sign, which would mean that this sign is "e" instead of "si". Note also that it is possible that there are traces of two small verticals above the sign read as TAB in this line and the next which would mean that the sign should be read "u₂" instead of "TAB!". On the second day of collations "SI" in "SI.A" still looks more like "SI" than "e". Though in the second instance at the end of the line the difference between SI and E is less certain.

6: {d}inana al-*e *a-*a <*mu>-*da-*an-*de₂ *u₂-<*ri>-<*li>-<na> <al>-<e/SI> *nu-*gi-*ga

NOTE: the sign read as "KU" is definitely LAGAB, but there are not any traces of a horizontal wedge inside the sign - in the corresponding sign in the next line, however, there are definitely traces of a horizontal wedge. And after "en" there are traces of the beginning of a sign, but no more signs are preserved in the break between this sign and "nu"? at the end of the line. Note also that it is possible that the sign read as "šul" is a poorly written "šul", but it is also possible that the sign is "hul₂" (it has roughly the same Gestalt as "šul" in the following lines but differs in a number of critical details, like the absence of the two small diagonal wedges at the beginning of the sign and the absence of a clear vertical in the bottom middle. Also "la" is completely certain, though the sign is partially poorly written.

NOTE: li and na are no longer preserved on the tablet and the same holds true for the corresponding part of the preceding line. Note also that at the end of the line the sign before "na" is probably not "da".

10: <*šul>-<*la> <*ba>-*da-*na *ba-*da-*na *u₂-*ri-<*li> [. . .] <*ba>?-**da-**na

NOTE: there is almost nothing left of the sign after "da", so "lam" is completely uncertain. Note "mu" is certainly possible, but "ŠI" is another possibility; I would say the traces support "MU" more than "ŠI" though.

NOTE: since the sign is broken, it is impossible to determine whether there are one or two horizontal wedges inside "NIN". This is true of all the NIN signs in the lines, where there may be faint traces of a second horizontal wedge, but it is difficult to determine with certainty.

In the "naŋ" in the next line, however, there does appear to be a slightly stronger traces of an inscribed vertical wedge. Note also that the space on the tablet under "kaš" and "mu" is broken and since there appears to be a slight trace of a Winkelhaken under "kaš", there may have been a gloss here (though it is possible that this is just a mark on the tablet and not a wedge).

&&AO 4316
Probably a little less than the top half of the tablet is missing.

Obv.
1: <*e₂><e> *{d}ba-*u₂ *bu-<*mu> [. . .]
  NOTE: the first sign is almost certainly "e₂" but it could be UŠ or "GA₂". There is also a small largely damaged area after the sign where there is room for one small sign, and "a" or "me" are possible, but this is far from certain. There is only one "u₂" in the line. There is also a sign written under the first sign that is approximately the same sign as "e₂", but which looks like <e> and could be a phonetic gloss. There is damage on the tablet after this sign, where there could have been a maximum of two to three signs, but from what is preserved of the surface of the tablet, it seems more likely than not that there were no signs here.

2: <*ši> <x>? *he₂-*em-*še-ge-<ge>? [. . .] 
  NOTE: there are faint traces of what is perhaps one sign - either "me" or a box-like sign, but the traces are very faint. It is possible that the sign read as "ge" is "ŋal₂", but the sign really looks more like an unusually written "gi", the traces of the broken next sign are equally consistent with "gi" (or ŋal₂), and since the break occurs right at the tablet edge it is unlikely that there was more than one sign in the break.

3: <*lu₂>? [x (x)] <he₂>-me-<*di> [. . .]
  NOTE: It is not impossible that the sign at the beginning of the line is "lu₂", but BAR or MAŠ + traces of the beginning of another sign after it are equally likely. A third, and less likely possibility is that the sign is "gi". But "lu₂" remains the most likely possibility. If the traces of the sign after the break really belong to "he₂", which is not completely certain, but possible (another less likely possibility would be to read "<KA>", and read the vertical of the first part of "me" as the end of "KA" followed possibly by another small sign instead), then there would only be space for one sign in the break after "lu₂". Note also that "di" is written before the end of the line, but there is not another sign in the space after "di" before the tablet edge (where the break begins). Note also that the break following this sign and the first sign in the next two lines seems to have been gouged out, perhaps by the shovel, when the tablet was excavated, so that the break is deep, but not very wide.

4: *AN [x (x) (x)] <MU>?-*na-<*ku>-<*ul>-*ku-*ul [. . .]
  NOTE: The traces after the break could belong to the end of "mu", and if they do it is unlikely that there were more than one or a maximum of two small signs in the break besides the first part of "mu". Note also that it is very likely that the sign after "na" is a small "ku", followed by "ul". The second "ul" continues on to the tablet edge and is followed by a break, but it is unlikely that there was another sign there.

5: <x> [x (x)] *re-<*e> <*he₂>-*hu-*le [. . .]
  NOTE: it is very likely that the traces that have been interpreted as belonging to the end of "he₂" do belong to the end of this sign, but this is not completely certain, and it is possible that this is the end of another sign. If this sign is he₂ though, it is very unlikely that there was another sign in the break between it and "e". Since "le" continues on to the tablet edge, it is unlikely that there was another sign in the break after this sign.

6: <*AN>? *ri <UN>? <*di> *{d}*ba-*u₂-*še₃!
  NOTE: it is extremely unlikely that the first sign is "ri", and "AN" or maybe even "lu₂" are much more probable. Another possibility is "gi". If the sign is "AN" then there is room for one small sign in the break after the sign, and if it is "lu₂" then "lu₂" would have taken up the whole space. It is extremely unlikely that the sign after "ri" is "UN" and "e", possibly followed by traces of another small sign is more likely. "DI" after this sign is almost completely certain and the last sign on the tablet (written on the tablet edge) is a box with three horizontal wedges, so "še₃" seems likely.
  NOTE also: it is possible that there is a dividing line following this line, but this seems very improbable, and if there is then it cuts through the tops of all of the signs in the next line. The only indication of a line here is at the end of the line where traces of a line follow the last sign and are also partly visible above "bu", but this could simply be a line ruling.

7: <*e₂>? *{d}*ba-*u₂ *bu-<*ŋa₂>?
  NOTE: it is possible that "AN" is incorrectly written as "BAR", but note that throughout the tablet the second wedge of "AN" is always very faint, and there also appear to be faint traces of a second wedge in this sign as well. "E₂" is likely at the beginning of the line, though "ŋiš' is also possible. The last sign in the line is either "ŋa₂", "e₂", or "ke₄" and there are traces of two clear small vertical wedges in the bottom left corner of the sign.

8: <*nin>-*niŋ₂-<*hu>-<*ur>-*su-*ga
  NOTE: it is very probable that the first sign in the line is "nin", and note the characteristic initial vertical wedge that is also found with "nin" in other tablets from this group. It is also possible that the sign read as "niŋ₂" is a "PA" with the two vertical wedges written on top of the bottom horizontal wedge instead of through the middle of it.

9: <*x> <x>? <*UR/RU> *saŋ *gal-*ŋu₁₀
  NOTE: there is a maximum of one sign between the first sign in the line and the sign that appears to be either "UR" or "RU" and it is possible that there was not any sign here. Note also that "ru" seems more likely than "ur" though it is possible that there was another sign here instead.

10: <*lugal/lu₂>? <KA>? <MI>? *di/ki *KA-*ŋu₁₀
  NOTE: it is also possible that the first sign in the line is "ŠI", but there does seem to be a trace of a vertical wedge at the end of the horizontal wedge of this sign, making it possible that there was another sign here instead. The reading of the next sign as "KA" is based entirely on the preserved traces of the end of the sign, which are consistent with "KA" and possibly faint traces of the head of "KA" preceding them, but "KA" is still far from certain. The sign following it begins with a single Winkelhaken followed by more wedges, so "MI" is possible, but far from certain - another less likely possibility is DU₇. The sign after this is definitely DI or KI, and note that is also possible that there are šeššig marks near the head of "KA", though this may be because KA was written over another sign.

11: *{d} [x x (x)] <*NI>? *ma-*mu-<*še₃>
  NOTE: there are probably only two signs in the break after "DINGIR" and it is probably that the second one is either "NI" or "DU₃" or a sign that ends with wedges like this. "ma" is completely certain, and there do also appear to be traces of "še₃" at the end of the line, though it is possible that this sign was erased by the scribe.

12: *lugal <di>? <x> <sa>? *ku-*ru-*uš
NOTE: "di" seems unlikely, and if it is "DI" then the sign is written much smaller than the other "DI" signs on the tablet. "SA" is possible, but note the presence of a horizontal wedge near the bottom of the line, below the bottom of the other signs in the line, right before this sign, which may either belong to the sign read as "sa" or to another sign before it.

13: {d}<*šul>-<*ša₃>-*ga-*na-*ŋu₁₀
  NOTE: "šul" and "ša₃" are barely preserved, but the traces of the signs on the tablet are consistent with these signs, and there is definitely only one "ša₃" and not two.

14: <*lugal>? <*da>?-<*nu>? <*BU>? [. . .]
  NOTE: "lugal" is far from certain, but "da" and "nu" seem much more likely.

NOTE: for dumu KA, see Shulgi F 70, with Laemmerhirt's commentary to the line on p.81 of his edition of the text. The lexeme, which in its most general sense seems to mean "descendant" (Nachkomme), is also discussed by Sjoeberg in HSAO 1: 209-212 where the form in this line (in this tablet) is also cited. Note that Sjoeberg (HSAO 1: 210-11) reads this line and the next: dumu KA ŋa₂ x [x] // {d}uraš-ša-kam [. . .]. Note, the sign after "dumu" really is "KA" and not "saŋ", with no ambiguity; the sign after it, however, is also almost certainly ŋa₂ and not e₂, raising the possibility that this phrase should be read: "dumu saŋ!-ŋa₂". As noted by Sjoeberg, in other texts (like Gudea Statue B), Bau is the first born daughter of An and Urash, so first-born daughter would seem to be more appropriate here, anyway.

&&AO 4327 = Cros, NFT p.203 (Cohen Source NN). The source is divided into cases and is 15.5+cm in height, 11+cm in width, and 2.5cm in thickness at the thickest point. When an estimate based on the tapering of the preserved part of the tablet edge and the width of each column is made the tablet was probably approximately 22cm in height and 16cm in width.

This text which begins with references to Enlil and the Ekur and includes a section with a passage with lines that begin with the phrase "ša₃-ŋu₁₀ {d}ba-u₂", may or may not be a lament to one or both of these deities. The tablet shares the same format and ductus as AO 4327 and the other sources in the early Isin-Larsa group, which may be an indication that this is a lament and not a hymn. The source also contains numerous phonetic writings. Here is a partial transliteration:

cols. ii and iii are both largely broken and the surface of the preserved parts of each column appears to be worn so only traces of signs were copied, but the last line in each of these columns reads:

col. iii (last line): di-mi-<ir> na-me-en / a-na zi nu-DU

NOTE: it is also uncertain how many columns are missing to the right of this column, but probably at least one or two.

&&AO 4331 + AO 4335 (NFT p.207): a multi-column tablet with the same format and ductus of the other early Isin-Larsa period laments in this group. Collated January 10,  2019.

obv. 
col. i'
NOTE: judging from the curvature of the top edge of the tablet it is very probable that this is either the first column of the tablet, or that there was a maximum of one column preceding it. 
1: [x x (x) (x)] <x> / [x x (x)] <*lu₂>? *na-*gul?
COLLATION NOTE: "gul" is probable, but another possibility is "DUL". The wedges at the end of the sign preceding "na" are consistent with "lu₂", but "ni", "er" or any other sign that ends with two converging diagonal wedges is also possible.

2: *zi *dumu *za-*me-*na-<*me>-*en
3: *a-*še-*er-*bi ŋa₂-*da / *te *mu-*da-*gu-*le
  COLLATION NOTE: "ŋa₂" is likely, but "e₂" is also possible.
4: *gu₂ <*e₃>(<*UD>?.*DU) *hul-*a u₂-ru / *hul-*a-*ŋu₁₀ *te *mu-*da / *gu-*le
  COLLATION NOTE: There seems to be space and even possibly traces of a small sign before DU that could be "UD", and the preceding sign is probably "gu₂". The signs u₂ and ru are written very small, and another possibility that they belong to a single sign, "ra" (though u₂-ru would seem to make more sense here).
5: [(x)] *dam-*ma *dumu-*a-*ŋu₁₀ / [. . .] <*gu>-*le
  CN: there is only space for a very small sign before "dam", but the vertical wedge at the top of the space before "dam" almost certainly belongs to the line ruling and not the sign.

7: [. . .] <x> / [. . .] <x>
rest of column broken

col. iii'
1: *nu-*mu-*uš-*ta-<*mu> / *dumu(-)*zu(OR: ba)(-)*e-*na-*mu
  CN: the sign read as UŠ seems to have only one diagonal wedge before the final vertical, whereas the next sign, which has the same shape, seems to have two diagonal wedges before the final vertical. Note also that it is possible that the sign read as "zu" is "ba" - but since the sign is identical to "zu" in the next line, it is more probable that it is "zu".
2: *ŋa₂-*ar-<<x>>-*e / *lu₂ *hur-*saŋ-*ŋa₂-*ke₄ 
  CN: the sign before "e" seems to have been deliberately erased or gouged out. There is no reason to assume, on the basis of the surviving traces, that the sign was "re". 
3: *{d}*mar-*tu *dumu *an-*na / *mu-*zu <*an>-*za-*še

col. iv'
1: *KA-*zu *en-*gu-*ra / *dumu *ŋiš-*la *nu-*du / *tu
  CN: The sign "zu" is probable, but not completely certain. It is possible that the sign at the end of the line is "um", but "ra" seems more likely. 
2: *za-*na-*am-*zu / *a-*ba *u₂-*um-*la / *ab-*bi *hu-*lu-*he₂
3: *za-*na-*am-*zu / *su-*ga *u₂-*um-*la / *su *e₂-*še *an-*ša₃
4: *a-*me *ba-*ra-*na <x> / *u₂-*um-*la [. . .] / *ki-*sur-<*ra> [. . .]
  CN: there seems to be an erasure after "la", so it is possible that "la" was the last sign in this part of the line. Note also that the sign read as "ki" is definitely "ki" and not "ša₃".

NOTE: the content of this column duplicates a section of DIL no. 13, an Ershemma to Dumuzi (= PRAK C 118 rev. col. v; BM 61892; and HS 1494). The score of those lines is repeated here. The main source for this part of the text is HS 1494 (TUM 3, 26).

7': *NINDA₂?i?-*ni-*{d}a *zi *ša₃-*ŋa₂ *balaŋ *kur-*ku *ban₃-*da 
  NOTE: the gloss is written under the first sign, and the first sign of the gloss is uncertain, but the second sign is definitely "da". (NOTE: all the glosses in this source are written directly under the sign). The "ni" and the "da" in the gloss are certain, but the first sign could be "i", "lu", or something else. It is tempting to read NINDA₂in-{d}a, but the sign on the tablet does not look enough like ninda₂ for this to be completely certain.

  NFT 207 (AO 4331 +) rev. i' 1': [. . .] / [. . .] / <*ku₃>? [. . .]
COLLATION NOTE: This is the first preserved line after a long break of at least half of the top half of the tablet. The only preserved sign at the beginning of the line begins with a diagonal wedge, and the most likely possibilities are ku₃, ša₃, or UD. Note the assumption that there were two half-lines before the line with this sign is an assumption, since the tablet is not preserved before this line and it is not possible to determine where the case that ended with this line began. This tablet is written in the same ductus as the other early Isin Period tablets from Girsu.

NOTE: Abu is usually identified as the son of Gula, and occurs frequently in connection with Bau. The connection with Enlil here seems unusual.
 NFT 207 (AO 4331 +) rev. i' 2': *lugal <*{d}>? [x x (x) (x)] / *{d}*AB-<*u₂> [x x (x)] / <*ba>-*ab-<*ga>-<*ri> [(x)]
COLLATION NOTE: It is very probable that the sign after lugal is {d}. The only preserved wedge is a horizontal wedge in the middle of the space for the sign (as opposed to the top or the bottom of the sign), so whatever the sign is must begin with a horizontal wedge in the middle of the beginning of the sign, and this is consistent with {d}. There is enough space after this sign for mu-ul-lil₂¬(-la₂) or en-lil₂(-la₂). The AB sign looks like it could have a Winkelhaken in the bottom right corner of the end of the sign, but this is not certain; the next sign is almost certainly u₂. The bottom left corner of "ba" is damaged, but it is probable that this sign is "ba". The sign "ga" is probable, and there are traces of at least one sign that seems to have a bottom horizontal wedge (the top half of the sign is not preserved) and space for another sign after this before the tablet edge. Note that is not impossible that this sign is "ri", though if this is the case, it is unlikely that it was preceded by "a". Note also that after comparing the traces of this sign to "ri" in the next line "ri" seems almost completely certain. It is also not improbable that the line ended with this sign - note that there are other lines in this column that end with a little space before the tablet edge.

  NOTE: the sign read as "erim₃" is probably not "erim₃", but rather a sign that looks more like "am". Note also that it is possible that the sign read as "a" in this line and the next is part of "edin" and not a separate sign.

The phrase u₃-mu-un erim₃-ma occurs as an epithet of Enlil in at least one other text, but the traces of the broken sign in the main source do not really support reading erim₃ here.

&&AO 13013 (NFT pl.52)
The top right corner of what could have been either a very large multi-column tablet, or the right half of a single column tablet. Note, however, the presence of multiple lines that continue on to the tablet edge, suggesting that the scribe had run out of space because the lines in column i did not leave enough room for the lines in column ii, making it (possibly) more likely that this is a multi-column tablet. Note also, however, that the signs are larger than in AO 12999, and arguably fuller as well, making it more likely that this tablet belongs to the older group of NFT tablets.

Obv.
Possible that this is a multi-column tablet, in which case this would be the beginning of column ii.
1: [. . .] <x> *lu₂-<*LU> *lu₂-<*LU> *mi *za-<*gin₃>!
  NOTE: neither LU is completely certain, but this does seem to be the most likely reading of at least the first of these two signs. "mi" is completely certain, but only two wedges of "gin₃" are visible on the tablet edge, and since these wedges are immediately adjacent to the sign read as "ZA", it is possible, but less likely that ZA and these wedges are to be read "HA" - in favor of za-gin₃ note the very clear MI za-gin₃s at the ends of lines 3 and 4. 

2: [. . .] <x> *ŋi₆-<*par₃>?-<*ke₄>? <*lu₂>-<*LU> *ki
  NOTE: par₃ is relatively certain, and ke₄ is possible, but slightly less certain. "lu₂" is possible but the wedges are very faded. Instead of "LU" another KI is possible, but this is difficult to determine. (Upon a second look at the tablet "lu₂-LU" seems much more certain). Note also that the signs read as "par₃ ke₄" are definitely not "ma-al" (as in the next line), though it is also possible that they are not "par₃ ke₄".

3: [. . .] <x> *MI <*ma>-<*al> *MI *za-*gin₃
  NOTE: for the signs after "MI" see the collation drawing. The sign read as "al" looks just like the "al" in rev. l.8', making it very likely that this sign is "AL" and the preceding sign is "ma".

4: [. . .] <ga>? <i₇>? *lu₂ *su₃!-*ge *MI *za-*gin₃
  NOTE: the only reason not to read "su₃" is the presence of a clear vertical wedge at the end of the sign, making it possible that this and the sign read as "gi" belong to a single sign (see collation drawing, where these two signs are drawn as they appear on the tablet).

5: [. . .] <*mu>-*lu₂ *am-*gin₇ *nu-*a-*ra *TUR *gu₄/ta?
  NOTE: in this and the following lines the second to last sign is clearly TUR and the following sign could be either GU₄, TA, or (less likely) GA (which can be almost completely ruled out on the basis of the two vertical wedges inside the "ga" in l.7) - the two signs are always written (almost completely) identically in each line, though (see collation drawing for a drawing of the two signs). 
  Compare UA Tablet 10, l.14': šeš-ŋu₁₀ mu-lu am-gin₇ nu₂-a-ra, a line which occurs in reference to Dumuzi.

6: [. . .] <x> *mu-*lu₂ *am-*gin₇ *nu-*a-*ra *TUR gu₄/ta?

7: [. . .] *gin₇ *lu *sila₄-*gin₇ *ri-*ga-*a-*ŋa₂ *TUR *gu₄/ta?
  NOTE: the sign read as "ŋa₂" is either "ŋa₂" or "ke₄" (though I suppose E₂ is also possible) - the most likely reading of the sign, though, is "ŋa₂". Note also that "u₈" is possible, but the sign really does look nearly identical to "udu" in the next line (i.e. there do not seem to be any additional wedges inside of LAGAB).
  Compare BM 100046 obv. 23: u₈-ŋu₁₀ he₂-LU sila₄-ŋu₁₀ he₂-rig₇ dili a-na mu-un-<AK> [. . .]
  My ewe being confused, my lamb being devoured - what am I to do alone?

8: [. . .] *gin₇ *lu *maš₂-*gin₇ *ri-[ga-a]-<*ŋa₂> *TUR *gu₄/ta?
  Compare BM 100046 obv. 24: ud₅-ŋu₁₀ he₂-LU maš₂-ŋu₁₀ he₂-rig₇ dili a-na mu-un-<AK> [. . .]

9: [. . .] <x> *bi *NE.*NE *an-<*na>
  NOTE: it seems more likely that the sign read as "bi" is "bi" instead of "ga", because there only seems to be one horizontal wedge in the sign, and it is closer to the beginning of the sign than the two wedges in "ga" in l.7, which take up the entire middle of the sign. Since the very first part of the sign is broken, it is possible that there was another small vertical wedge in the break, so "ga" cannot be ruled out completely. Note also that "na" is the best reading for the last sign in the line, but the sign is not drawn perfectly. "AN", however, is completely certain.

10: [. . .] <x> <x> <x>  <*an>?-<*na>?
  NOTE: an-na at the end of the line is far from completely certain, but when the few traces of the two very partially preserved sign at the end of the tablet edge are compared to "an-na" in the previous line, they are not inconsistent with these two signs.

Rev. (col. iii?)
beginning of reverse broken
1': [. . .] <*ki>?-*en?
  NOTE: KI is far from certain, and "di", "ba", "su", etc. are also possible, but whatever the sign is, it appears to be identical to the sign that precedes the same EN-like sign at the end of l.3', and the last sign in the line has the exact same Gestalt as EN, but the presence of what appear to be two vertical wedges at the top left of the beginning of the sign call this reading into question. It maybe possible that this is a ligature of "me-en", but this is even more unlikely. Same two signs also occur at the end of l.3'.

2': [. . .] <x> *mi-*na-*ra-*zi

3': [. . .] <*ki>?-*en?

4': [. . .] <*ra>?(-)*ni-*in-*ba-*u₂

5': [. . .] <x>? *u₂
  NOTE: it is possible that the traces of the first preserved sign belong to "ni", but this is far from certain. Note also that though the last sign is probably "u₂", the two horizontal wedges that cross through it run on a slight diagonal, unlike the two wedges in the sign at the end of the preceding line, which are more horizontal. Although, u₂ is the most likely, it is thus also possible, but unlikely, that this sign is "RU". 

6': [. . .] <*mu>?-*ra-*ni-*in-*ba-*u₂
  NOTE: here the two horizontal wedge that cross through the middle of the last sign do not run past the final vertical in the sign, making this sign look more like "ke₄" than "u₂", but since in the preceding two lines the wedges cross past the final vertical, u₂ still seems like the most likely reading of this sign. Note also that the traces of the sign read as "mu" are really very faint, and though consistent with "mu", "mu" should really only be considered as a tentative possibility.

7': [. . .] <x> <HI>?-<x>-<*ŋa₂>
  NOTE: the sign read as "HI" is extremely uncertain, as are the signs preceding and following it, which are almost completely unpreserved. The "ŋa₂" at the end of the line, however, is much more likely, though not completely certain, since the final vertical wedge in the sign is difficult to make out with certainty.

8': [. . .] <KI/KA>?-<*la>? *i₃-<*ma>-*al
  NOTE: the first sign is completely certain, but the traces of the next sign really do support reading "la", and it is difficult to imagine what else the sign could be ("ra" is the only other reasonable possibility, but the wedges at the beginning of the sign are spaced unevenly, as they would be for "la", and unlike "ra" in the next line, where the wedges at the beginning of the sign seem to be parallel).

9': [. . .] <x> *ga-*ra-*da-<*DU>
  NOTE: "DU" is not entirely certain, but it is difficult to imagine what else the traces of the final sign in the line could be, and there are traces of at least two parallel horizontal wedges at the top and bottom of the sign.

  NOTE: Cavigneaux, in JAOS 113 (1993): 255, argues that i-me bi-la-bi in this and obv. 11' is a writing for im-me gibil₄-la-bi, which he translates "elle ne cesse de dire", citing Krecher SKL p.112 for citations in which the same phrase occurs (PRAK B 471 col. i 16 and AO 6905a obv. 15'). Note also that it is possible that the sign before ma is me.

  Note: it is possible that the sign read as "ga" is "bi", but since there are two horizontal wedges inside the beginning of the sign and "bi" is written without verticals throughout the tablet, "ga" seems more likely.

  Note: it is possible that the first sign in the line is "ŋiš", but since it is wider than "ŋiš" typically is "e₂" seems more likely. Note, however, that there are also no vertical wedges inside the sign.

  NOTE: mu₂ is written over what looks like ZI+ZI.LAGAB = numun₂, providing a very clear indication that scribe intending to write numun₂ phonetically made a mistake and accidentally wrote it in normal orthography before recognizing the error and writing it phonetically.

  Note: "de₃" is possible on the basis of the few preserved traces, but it is also possible that this is another sign. Note also that the beginning of the sign read as "bi" here looks nothing like the beginning of the other "bi" signs throughout the tablet and the traces really do suggest a sign like "e" instead.

  There is a deep hole on tablet after "kur" which is large enough for "gul" where it looks like the scribe has intentionally gauged out the sign.

7: <*lil₂>-<*la₂> en-<*na>? ga-ša-an tur₃ amaš-<*ke₄>
  The lil₂-la₂ at the beginning of the line is not entirely certain, but is likely. There is no trace of "AN" on the side of the tablet as claimed by Cohen, though, and the absence of AN was also confirmed by looking again at the photo.
  K₁ 5: *e₂-*lil₂ ga-ša-an-<*tur₃> <*ama>-*sa [. . .] 
  Note: the traces of the sign read as "ama" are consistent with "ama", though they do not necessitate it; since "ama-sa" would be a sensible phonetic writing of "amaš", however, it seems likely that the sign is "ama". Also: Cavigneax JAOS 113 (1993), p.256 reads this line E₂.LIL₂ ga-ša-an <tur₃> [a]-<ma>-sa [. . .]. I've noted after looking at the photo again that <a>-<ma>-sa is equally possible.

  K₁ 9: <x> *hu-*hu-*te *ba-*bi-*ra-*bi 
  Note: the "ta" sign here looks different and is more simplified and schematic than the "ta" signs in the preceding lines - Cavigneaux in JAOS 113 (1993), 256 argues that "ta" in this and the following lines is to be read "te", which seems reasonable.

16: ga-ša-an-*bi gi₁₆-le-eŋ₃-ŋa₂-*de₃ *ba-*ra-*e₃ <*nam>?-*e₃-*a-*bi
After examining the photo again, I noted that the tablet has been (deliberately?) scratched on the surface in the place where the sign read as "nam" would be, as well as in the place where I have read "a? traces?" in l.18, making it very difficult to determine, what if anything was intended to be written in these places.
  K₁ 13: [x x (x)] <*bi> *ge-*le-*de₂ [. . .] 
  Note: there may be very faint traces of the ends of two vertical wedges at the beginning of the line, but it is equally possible that this is illusory. 
  Ur₁: omits

S: ge-le-de₂ for gi₁₆-le-eŋ₃

  K₁ 14: *uru₂ <*e> *<du>-*qa <*e> *gi-*ya [. . .] K₁A (PRAK B 442, col. i, 1''): [. . .] za
  Note: it is possible that the second sign in the line is "da", but since the second part of the sign is completely broken and the possible traces of two Winkelhaken may be illusory, and the beginning of the sign is completely consistent with "e", "e" seems more likely. Note also that there are definitely traces of a vertical wedge in the top right corner of the broken sign before "gi" making it impossible that this sign is "i" and more likely that it is "e". Cavigneaux JAOS 113 (1993), 256 argues that the beginning of the line in K₁ is to be read "uru₂ du-qa" without "e".

Note: it is also possible that the sign read as "šu" is "DUL", as Cohen 1988, 548 reads it. Note, however, that the sign before "ki' is definitely not "saŋ", and the signs before this are not "an-ne₂", as Cohen reads them.

  Note the repetition of this line in Ur₁ rev. 6: uru(₂)?? {ki} nam-tar gig-ga te(OR: im?)-ba DU?-a-ŋu₁₀. After looking at the photo again, the sign read as "te" really does look a lot more like "te" than "im". If this is the case, then "te" may be a writing of "de₃", which would result in the translation: "My city which was built so that it would have a bitter fate" (assuming that "DU" is a phonetic writing of "du₃"). 

Nin₁ 12': [. . .] na-aŋ₂-tar gig-ga <im> [. . .]

  Note: the traces of the first sign are consistent with "uru₂", but do not necesssitate it. Note also that there appear to be traces of at least one horizontal wedge inside the beginning of the sign read as "bi" making it possible that this sign is "ga". The "la" at the end of the line, however, is clear and unambiguous.

Note: after looking at the photo again it is not entirely certain that the sign read as "dingir" is actually "dingir" or another sign - if it is another sign though, it is almost impossible that it is "KU". Note also that the du₇ at the end of this line and the du₇ at the end of the next line are tightly squeezed together, but it does seem very likely that both signs are du₇. Cavigneaux 1993, 254 reads: e₂ tuku!-bi e₂-a-na nu-du₇, and argues that "tuku" is just as likely as "AN". Another look at the photo supports this interpretation, since the sign really does look more like "tuku" than "an", but the possibility should still be left open that another sign was intended here.
  K₁ 30': *e₂ *KU-*be₂ '' *+e-*ya(-)*nu(-)*+du₃!(NI) [(x)]
  Note: I originally read "e₂" instead of "e" for the second "e₂" in the line, but the photo really does suggest "e" instead of "e₂". Cavigneaux 1993, p.254 reads this line and the following line: e₂ {tu}-ku-bi e₂-ya nu-zal // ma-gi-ur tu-ku-bi šu nu-du GIŠ?, and also considers the possibility that "e₂ ku-bi" is a phonetic writing for "e₂ tuku-bi".

37: *mu-*un-*ga *+bar-*ta '' *šu *nu-<un>-du₇
Note that the sign read as "ni" by Cohen is probably "bar"; this is not entirely, however, and should be collated again with the tablet. Either way though, it is highly improbable that the sign is "ni". Note also that this "du₇" and the sign at the end of the previous line could be two "du₇" signs written closely together.
  K¬₁ 31': *ma-*gi-*ur *tu-*ku-*bi *+šu *nu-*du-*+ud / <<gu2/HI>>?
  Note: it is possible that the last sign in the line is not "UD" but "ŋiš" or an "e₂" without any vertical wedges inside the sign, but "UD" seems the most likely; the only thing that speaks against it being "UD" is that throughout the tablet the final vertical of "UD" typically has two wedges. Note also that there are faint traces of a sign directly beneath "UD" and above "um" at the end of the next line, which may belong to an erased(?) "gi" or "gu₂". Since, however, the traces of this sign look very similar to the sign read as "gu₂/gi" at the end of l.10' it is possible that the scribe was copying from another exemplar and that his or her eyes accidentally skipped over to the end of l.10' before the mistake was realized and the mistake was erased. Note also that "šu" may have been written over another sign making it look a little like "ya" without the second vertical wedge at the end of the sign.

It is possible that there is a broken sign before "i" and the sign read as "gig" is far from certain. 
Cavigneaux 1993, 255 reads "ur-bi ad₆-a" at the beginning of the line. A new look at the photo does suggest that a sign like LU₂ with another sign inscribed in it is not impossible, but still far from certain and the traces could just as easily support "ah/uh", which would make just as much sense in the context of this line.

39: uga(U₂.NAGA.GA)*+<mušen>-*+a-*bi '' *+ad₆ *im-*da-+ku₂!(KA)-*e
The sign at the end of the line is definitely "e" and not "mar". For the signs at the beginning of the line see collation drawing for this line. Note also that the "a" before "bi" is almost completely certain, though it is possibly that the sign read as "mušen" was incorrectly written as "RI". Note lastly, that it is possible (though unlikely) that there are traces of a sign before "ad₆" in this line and before "i" in the previous line.
  K₁ 33': *u₄-*ga-*bi *ad-*ti!(BALA) *im-*da-*gu₂-*e
  Note: the sign read as "ad" is not a perfect "ad", but since the traces more closely resemble this sign than any of the other signs that could be confused with it, "ad" seems likely. Note also that the sign before "e" looks nearly identical to the sign that may have been erased at the end of l.8' and though the three vertical wedges are written at the top right corner of the sign it is possible that this sign is "gi¬₄" instead of "gu₂" (or another sign entirely). For a point of comparison compare the sign "gu₂" in the first line of col. iii where the three Winkelhaken at the end of the sign are not written above the first two horizontal wedges of the sign, unlike "gi" where there are at least one or two examples on the tablet of the wedges being written above the main horizontal wedge in the sign.
Cavigneaux 1993, 255 reads: u₄¬-ga-bi at-ti-im-da-gu₂-e, which provides a better explanation for "bala", but the sign really does look more like "bala" than "ti".

46: *i₇-*da *+dib(DAB)-*ba *+ŋiš*+<ma₂> [. . .] '' <*+GAM>
Note that directly before the signs read as "GAM" in this line and the preceding line the tablet is entirely broken, making it impossible to determine whether these wedges are their own sign or whether they belong to the end of another sign. Note also that the aligment of the ends of the lines is uncertain from here on down and that Cohen attributes all of these signs to the following lines, which seems impossible based on the layout of the tablet. 
  K₁ 36': *id-*di-*pa *ma-*tu *ma-*nu-<*um> *ma-*tu / <x>? <x>? <*ur> *in-*ga
  Note: it is possible, though not very likely, that there are traces of two small wedges (large enough to be a sign like "MI₂" but no larger) directly before the sign read as "ur" in the second part of the line - however, it seems even less likely that there is a sign before this one at the beginning of the second part of the line. Note also that it is possible that the sign read as "um", which is mostly broken on the tablet, is another sign such as "tu", but since "um" makes the most sense and is not completely inconsistent with the preserved traces, it is probably the most likely (note, the same observation applies to "um" at the end of the first part of the next line). The problem is that the surface of the tablet is scratched away on the tablet where the sign read as "um" is written, and it is difficult to determine whether this was a deliberate erasure, or whether a sign such as "um" or "tu" was intended here.

49: *e₄ *nu-*zu-*gin₇ *e₄ <*+e>? [. . .] '' <*+x>?-*+e
The sign after "a" is definitely not "u₅", but it is not entirely certain that it is "e", either -- another possibility is that it is the beginning of "UD", but this is also uncertain. Whatever the sign is, though, it is separated from the preceding "a" and may not be a case ending belonging to that word. Also, the last sign in the line is almost certainly "e" and not "mar" - note, for example, that the vertical wedge in the middle of the sign seems to begin below the top horizontal wedge, which is what would be expected for "e", but not "mar". The sign read as "gin₇" is probably "gin₇", but it is also possible that it is "ba" (though fairly unlikely). Same holds true for the next line.
  K₁ 39': *e₂ nu-*zu!(MA?)-bi *e₂-*e *ba-*ga
  Note: the top part of the inside of the sign read as "zu" has been erased by the scribe and like "zu" in the next line looks a little more like "ma" than "zu", though an incorrectly written "zu" is certainly possible (in both lines).

Also, the sign after "dam" looks more like saŋ than sa₆, which also seems like a more likely reading in light of the corresponding form in G₁.

Note Cavigneaux 1993, 255 reads the beginning of the line "ama-gan zi!". While "zi" seems almost completely certain, it is a little less certain that the sign before it is "gan", though "gan" does seem much more likely than "ad".
  K₁ (PRAK C 121, col. ii, l.3''): *e-*mi-*ga *zi <*u₂> [. . .]
  Note: of all the signs that the sign after "zi" could be (such as "ga" or "ru"), "u₂" seems by far to be the most likely.

Although the sign read as "še₃" in this line and the next only has one horizontal, it is too box-shaped to be "ba". Also "ŋin" is entirely certain.
  K₁ (PRAK C 121, col. ii, l.4''): <*u₂>-*še *ŋa₂-*na-*ŋu₁₀ <*i> [. . .]
Note: The sign after "mu" at the end of this line, of which only the first half of the sign is preserved, could be either "da" or "i", but since the main source has "ŋin-na-ŋu₁₀" as a corresponding form, and -da- would be expected with "ba-" and not "mu-", it is more likely that the sign is "i" and not "da".

91 (25): *ur-*šu-*+AK-*ŋu₁₀ *lu₂ *kur₂-<*ra> '' *nam *mu-<*un>-<na>?-<*+zu>-<*+zu>
Although, I had originally suggested reading "egir" instead of "AK" at the beginning of the line, looking at the photograph more closely really does suggest that the sign is "AK" and not "egir". Also, the last four signs in the verbal form at the end of the line are mostly broken, but "zu-zu" is well supported by the preserved parts of the sign, as is "un". The sign read as "na", however, is a little less certain, and could be "da", though "na" may be more likely.
  K¬₁ (col. ii, 7''): *+u₄-*+šu!-*a-*qa-*ŋu₁₀ *lu <*+ku> <x>? [. . .]
  Note: while it is possible that the second sign in the line is a very squeezed "ur₂", it is equally probable that "šu" was written over another sign that has been erased, which seems more likely in light of the corresponding form in NCBT 688. For the improbability that this sign is "dam" compare this sign to "dam" at the beginning of l.4 in column iii, which looks very different.

Note: a bolder reading of the beginning of the line would be: tumušen <tur-tur tumušen gal-gin₇> but this is really difficult to verify, especially since nu-zu-zu in the next line is epigraphically certain. Regardless of whether this is correct, however, there are traces of at least two signs between tur-tur and nu-zu-zu, and since the traces are not inconsistent with mu and another sign, it will tentatively be assumed that this source, like K₁, also has mu and another sign.

------ *this is the end of col. ii in source K₁ and there is a double dividing line after this line and directly before the bottom edge on the tablet -------
As noted by Volk 1989, 5 the double dividing line (as opposed to a single dividing line) in K₁ may indicate that the following Kirugu (3) has been omitted.

  K₁ (col. iii, l.1): <*+gu₂> *im-*mi-*a-*ri *gu₂-*ru-*na *na-*na-<*a>?
  Note: there are only two Winkelhaken preserved at the end of the first sign in the line so either "gu₂" or "gu" would be possible. Note also that "ru" after "gu₂" is completely certain. Note lastly that there are traces of at least one vertical wedge slightly above the last "na" in the line which do not belong to "tu", the first sign in the first line of col. iv, and which could belong to "a". Note also that col. iii is written on the left side of the reverse of the tablet where col. iv would normally appear; i.e. the typical sequence of columns iii and iv is reversed on this tablet.

  K₁ (rev. col. iii., l.2): *nu-*gi-*a-*na *ga-*ša-*an-*na *UNUG '' *{ki}-*a
  Note: it is not impossible that the sign read as "UNUG" is "UNUG", but it could also be another sign; note alse that the wedges inside the sign read as "ki" are not preserved and that "ki" is written apart from the sign read as "UNUG" at the end of the line. Note also that is seems very probable that there is an "a" sign after "ki" which is very close to the beginning of the adjacent line in col. iv, but which does not seem to belong to the sign at the beginning of that line.

  X₁ (9b'): *nu-gig an-na ga-ša-an-an-na men₃

  Note: there are traces of two vertical wedges after "RU" at the beginning of the line belonging to the sign "a" which may or may not have been erased by the scribe. Note also that it is possible that the sign read as "ya" is a different sign, but the traces are consistent with "ya" and is not certain what other sign it could be. Note lastly that there are traces of two vertical wedges at the end of the line that could belong to "a" instead of to the beginning of the first sign in the adjacent line in column iv; this is very difficult to determine with certainty, however, since the first sign in the adjacent line is "e₂" and these two verticals could just as easily belong to the inside of the sign and it may be better to assume that there is not an "a" at the end of the line.

  Note: There are traces of a sign after "dumu" which may belong to the sign "ya", but which seem to have been intentionally erased by the scribe, making it likely that only "dumu" was intended here.

Note: the second part of the sign read as am₃ really does look a little more like "ŠI" than like "AN", but the sign is squeezed and in light of the clear am₃- signs in the corresponding forms in X₁ and X₂, am₃ was almost certainly the intended sign. 
  K₁ (5): *i-*bi *u₄-*da-*ke *i-*bi *+a-*mi-*DU
  Note: there are no traces of the three horizontal wedges that characterize "ga" in this source in the sign read as "bi" (as there are with "ga" in the next line) making it more likely that the sign is "bi" instead of "ga".

Note: there are traces of a two-sign gloss to the bottom left of "-le-na" and between the top right of "-e" and above "mu-gig" in the next line, which may read "i-ta", where "i" is almost completely certain and "ta" slightly less so. If this gloss goes with the verbal form in this line (l.103) then this may be a variant gloss indicating the possibility of -ta at the end of this form as an alternative to "-na".
  K₁ (9): *+e₂ *+ku-*+ga-*+ni *+a-*+nin *+mu-*+til-*+la-*+ni
  Note: the sign read as "nin" is definitely "NIN" and not "dam".

  Note: the second "e₂" in the line is written over another sign, but is definitely "e₂". Note also that the second, partially preserved, sign could be "si" (for "zi"?) or (less likely?) "ku" with a stray mark that looks like a small vertical inside the top part of the sign. Note, however, that there is also a large erasure under the first two signs in the line where the scribe may have gouged out part of the tablet, where there may have been a gloss or an attempt to erase both of these signs.
  Ur₁ (rev. 20): e₂ ku₃-ga-ni-a nin mu-ul-ti-la-am₃
Note: Cavigneaux 1993, 256 reads "ku₃-ga-ni-a nin mu-ul-ti-la-am₃" and interprets "nin" "sans doute" as a writing of the adverb "ne-en".
  Ur₁ (rev. 21): e₂ ku₃ e₂-še {d}nanna(ŠEŠ.KI) in-dam *+u₂ *+gid₂-da

  Ur₁ (rev. 22): <x> mu-bi li tur bi-ir-bi-ri-ba in-du₁₁-ga / a-<ta>?
Note: Cohen reads -a-ta, but I read "-am₃" in my collation notes. Since the photo of the tablet I took does not have the tablet edge, and I didn't draw the sign, though, and Ludwig's copy has a sign that looks more like "ta" than "AN" after "a", it is possible that my notes are mistaken.
  Ur₁ (rev. 23): <x> *+{ki} zi-da a₂ ba-GAM-ma-ni <gu>?-<ŋa₂>? / *mu-*mu-zu?
  Note: the sign read as "GAM" could also be "TAR". Also, the traces of the sign after "ni" look more like "gu", but could also support "mu"
  Ur₁ (rev. 24): <x> *an-*na-ke₄? *+niŋ₂ ki-*sa-<da>? mu-<ud>? *+še-*+er <(x)>
  Note: Cohen reads "da" instead of "ke₄", which is also possible, as is his reading "ša₃" instead of "ki" after "niŋ₂".

Cavigneaux 1993, 255 reads the end of this line "im-me gibil₄-la-bi" translating "elle ne cesse de dire" and citing Krecher's SKL p.112 for a similar view. He also notes that CBS 106, l.11-14 may have parallels to this and the following lines. A new look at the tablet reveals that "la₂-bi" at the end of the line is possible, though it should be noted that the sign read as "la₂" could just as easily be "me", especially since the horizontal wedge seems to be closer to the middle of the sign than the top. 
  K₁ (11): <*šir₃> *sa-*ŋa₂-*a!-*na-*mi *ma-<*ma> [. . .]
  Note: "a" seems to have been written over "na" creating a sign that preserves the beginning of a "na" that ends with two final verticals instead of one, making it possible that this sign is a ligature of "na" and "a" instead of "a" over an erased "na".

  Note: the sign read as "la" at the end of the line, which is written on the reverse of the tablet, look a lot like "ma", but in light of Cavigneaux's interpretation of the line, the possibility should probably be left open that this sign is "la", especially since there does not seem to be a bottom part to the sign, and there is a dividing line (from the reverse) directly beneath it.

  Note: the traces of "MIN" with each of the "ŠI" signs at the end of the line are faint and possibly not present, but since they are definitely present with the two "ŠI" signs in l.18' it seems likely that they are also written here to distinguish this "ši", which is to be read "še₈" from the normal read of "ši" - in support of this note that the "ŠI" in this line written with "A" for "ir₂" definitely does not have "MIN" written with it. Note also that through the tablet "A" and "MIN" are generally indistinguishable making it likely that the sign after "gi₄" is to be read "a" and not "MIN".
  X₁ (16'): [x (x)] <*x> *lu *ma-*ma-*al-*la ni₂ me-lam₂-ma!(*LA)-*bi '' *MIN *ta-*pi
  Note: there is definitely a "la" sign after "me-lam₂". Note also that it is tempting to read the signs after "MIN" as "he-pi" with a stray vertical wedge at the end of "HE", especially since "PI" is definite and the sign read as "te/ta" seems to have two Winkelhaken at the beginning of the sign instead of two horizontal wedges, like "ta" in l.14'. But this nonetheless makes the presence of a stray vertical difficult to explain and "te" may thus be more likely. In any case, however, the first part of the sign is consistent with "HE".

Note also that the sign read as "ti" in this line and the next looks a little like "NUMUN" and is written like a "BAD" sign with a single diagonal wedge going through the top of the beginning of the sign. Note finally that signs from the end of a line on the reverse continue all the way up to "ti" which may indicate that the line was orginally longer and that the scribe did not have enough space to finish the line (or simply wrote the next part of the line in the next line - which might account for why there is blank space on the tablet after "ti!" in the next line).

  Note: there is a large blank space on the tablet between "a" and "ta", which may indicate that "ta" is not attached to the verbal from, but is instead the interrogative pronoun "ta", which is possibly followed by "A". Note also that it is possible of course that the sign read as "MIN" is "a" and is meant to follow "ŋa₂", especially since it occurs more closely to the beginning of the line than the other "MIN" line-dividers in this source.

Sign read as i₇ looks a little like A.DA; sign read as ku₃ looks a lot like "ša₃"; but note it also does not look exactly identical to ša₃ later in the line. Sign read as "ma" could be either "ma" or "ba".

  Note: It is possible that the sign at the beginning of the line is a poorly written "i₇", since there seem to be too many wedges in the sign for the sign to be "e₂". Since the sign is not definitely "i₇" either, though, the possibility should probably be left open that the sign is "e₂!". There are faint traces of a vertical wedge which may have been added after "KU" and directly before "ŋa₂" that probably belongs to "ŋa₂" if it belongs to any sign at all (compare "ŋa₂" earlier in this line which also seems to have a stray vertical at the beginning of the sign). Note also that the last preserved sign in the line is almost definitely not "MI" since the traces of the sign after "U" look very much like the beginning of "MU".

123-126: This Kirugu, which is the 5th Kirugu in NCBT 688, is preserved in almost identical form in Su₁, but in a completely different form in K₁A (PRAK B 442, rev. 2''-6'') and X₁, which read:

  Note: the third preserved sign in this line seems to be identical to the sign after "dar" in l.8 and it consists of two closely spaced vertical wedges with a faint horizontal wedge going through the bottom of the sign. Note also that the way the sign read as "lu" is written looks very similar to the sign "u₂" in l.18, and if it is in fact "lu" here then the sign shares its final vertical with the first vertical wedge of the following "a".

  NOTE: in CT 42, 1 (the main NB source for OAS = Kutscher source C) rev. 32'-35' = OAS *103-*107, there is a passage that overlaps with lines 1'-4'. This passage occurs in a kirugu with the incipit: za-e mah-en za-e mah me-en -- a kirugu that occurs at least one kirugu later than the kirugu preserved in obv. 31-40, which overlaps with the lines in col. iii 3'-11' of this source, indicating that the lines in these section continue to correspond to OAS. Some of these lines also occur in CNMA col. ii 5-6, a source which also contains earlier lines which overlap with some of the earlier lines in this source.

[NOTE: this source is also transliterated in the DIL translation file, above]

*) O.17 (Limet, Akkadica 2000: 3-7)

Dingir-Mah/Aruru Ershemma + Nin-nigara Lament
The Ershemma to Dingir-Mah and Aruru is preserved in nearly identical form (with some important differences) in L.1501 (ISET 1, p.227)and O.17 (Limet, Akkadica 2000: 3-7 -- but since Limet's transliteration has numerous errors, the photograph of the tablet by Gabbay was used to improve the transliteration whenever possible), both of which are identified in their colophons as Ershemmas. Most, but not all, of the Ershemma in these two sources is duplicated in the first section of BM 96936 (CT 58, 20), a six-column tablet containing the final Kirugus of a Balag to Nin-nigara. Note, however, that the first two lines of BM 96936, and the last line of the first section, are different from the first two lines and the last lines of L.1501 and O.17, indicating that these sources contain a "different" text than the first section of BM 96936. The Ershemma is translated first, using the first section of BM 96936 as the main source, and then followed by the rest of BM 96936.

Obv. 
col. i
1: ma? niŋin₃-ŋar-ra-ka ki-a <mu>-<ni>-ib-be₂
  L.1501 obv. 1: tumušen a-še-er su tumušen!(RI) a-še-er-<gin₇>
  = catalogues B₂, B₃, and B₄ = tumušen a-še-er su₃ = Cohen No. 96.
NOTE: the photo on the BM website is too small to make out too many details, but the first sign in the line, and the corresponding sign in the next line, looks more like "ma" than "e₂" or "erim₃", but the reading of the sign is still uncertain. In support of "ma", compare SBH 31: 19 e₂ niŋin₃-mar-ra (see Krecher SKL 128f. for an extended discussion of this deity and her name).
  O. 17 obv. 1: [tumušen a]-ši-ir *su(OR: zu?) tu-<*um>-<*ma>? <*di> [(x) (x)]
NOTE: the signs after "tu" are difficult to make out from the photo, but the sign after "TU" is definitely either "um" or "ra" and the sign following that is either "ma" or possibly (but less likely) "di". If the signs are read tu-um-ma-sa₂(OR: ši) [. . .] this could be taken as a phonetic writing for "tumušen a-[še-er-gin₇]", but this is epigraphically difficult. It is also very difficult to determine whether there are one or two horizontal wedges in the sign read as "su" in this line and the next, so it is possible that the sign is either "su" or "zu"; given the writing "su₃" in the catalogues, however, "su" seems more likely. O.17 is Lament no. 3 to Aruru in Black's catalogue of Aruru laments in the Klein Fs.
  O. 17 obv. 2: [ga-ša-an]? {d}a-ru-ru a-ši-ir su?
NOTE: given the probability that "ra" is written after "tu" in O.17, it is possible that the "re" in L.1501 is not a mistake for "mušen", but instead that the form is meant to be read "tu-re" 'sick one', instead of as tumušen.
NOTE: the e₂-niŋin₃-ŋar-ra usually refers to one of Inana's temples in Zabalam, Akkad, or Shuruppak.

At the Nigingara-house, she calls out at that place.
L.1501: The dove, in extended lamenting, the dove, like one lamenting (OR: like a sick person lamenting).

2: mu-gig gi?-DIŠ? ma? niŋin₃-ŋar-ra-ka / ki-a mu-ni-ib-be₂
NOTE: -ke₄ cannot be ruled out at the end of the first part of the line, but the top and bottom wedges at the head of the sign seem to be diagonal and not vertical wedges, unlike the clear "ke₄" at the end of the next line.
L.1501: omits
O.17: omits

The mistress (with) a 1-reed (measuring rod)?, at the Nigin-gara-house, calls out at that place.

O.17 obv. 3: [ga-ša]-<an>-niŋ₂-ŋa₂-ra *bar *ki *ku₃-*ga *men₃
  For these lines, which are parallel to other Ninisina litanies, see SKL 119-120.

Nin-Ningara, of the pure place.

4: {d}en-a₂-nun ama kurku₂(KA.AN.NI.SI)-ke₄
L. 1501 obv. 2: {d}en-a₂-nun ama kurku₂ men₃
  NOTE: Gabbay HES 2: 83 translates ama kurku₂ "mother of desire".
O. 17 obv. 4: [. . .] *nin *ama *kur-*kur men₃
NOTE: according to Krecher's commentary to Enanun in SKL p.126, Enanun is sometimes equated directly with Ninisina, and both are identified as the wife of Pabilsag, who play a role later in this text. Krecher reads the epithet as gu₃-an-ne₂-si = "one whose voice fills the heaven", but the writing kur-kur in O.17 makes it clear that the reading "kurku₂" is intended.

Enanun, mother of the floodwave.

5: ama e₂ mah ama e₂ gal-la-<ke₄>
L. 1501 obv. 4: ama e₂ mah-a ama e₂ gal-la men₃
O.17 obv. 6: [ama] e₂ mah ama e₂ gal-la men₃
O.17 obv. 7: [ga]-ša-an eš-de ga-ša-an la-ra-ga men₃
  NOTE: eš-de is a phonetic writing for aš-te -- this and the following epithet are from the standard epithets of Gula - see Gabbay HES 1: 51.
O.17 obv. 8: <ama> e₂-*e {d}ašnan-na ku₃-su₃ men₃!

9: šu tur-tur-e mi₂ zi di-de₃
L. 1501 obv. 8: šu tur-tur-re mi₂ zi di-de₃-<en> 
O.17 obv. 9: šu tur-tur-*ra *mu-*un-*zi-*zi-*de₃

To tend to the ones with little hands.

10: šu gal-gal *kin(OR: ur₄) <*šu> *gi₄-*gi₄-*de₃
  NOTE: "si" instead of "šu" is possible, but it is difficult to determine from the photo.
L. 1501 obv. 9: šu gal-gal kin(OR: ur₄) <šu>? gi-gi-de₃-<en>
O.17 obv. 10: šu gal-gal *kin(OR: ur₄) *ši *gi₄-*gi₄-*de₃
  NOTE: the sign read as "kin" in BM 96936 seems to have too many wedges to be "tuku", but the corresponding sign in O.17 is either "tuku" or a simplified form of "kin", and since the copy of L.1501 has a sign that also looks more complex than "tuku" and closer to "kin", it may be better to assume that "kin" was intended here. 

To have the ones with large hands perform manual work(?)

11: šu zi-da-*ŋa₂ *gana₂? *bil₂-*la₂-*e-<*de₃>
NOTE: The sign read as "gana₂" is almost certainly not "ki" or "šu", and since the bottom horizontal wedge is longer the top horizontal wedges and both wedges seem to angle down at an angle, "gana₂" is not unlikely. Note also that the following sign is either NE or NExPAP, and this may be a phonetic writing of "bala".
L.1501 obv. 10: šu zi-da-ŋu₁₀ gana₂!(copy has "ki") bala-e-de₃-[en] 
O.17 obv. 11: šu zi-da-ŋu₁₀(over an erased sign) *gana₂ bala-e-*de₃
NOTE: the sign on the tablet is definitely KAR₂ or GANA₂, and it is unlikely that this sign is a poorly written "ki".
VAT 3606 obv. 1': [. . .] <bala>? [. . .]
  NOTE: the surface of the obverse of VAT 3606 is very worn, making it very difficult to read in places.

12: gub₃-bu-ŋa₂ nam-<šul> *gi₄-*gi₄-*de₃
L. 1501 obv. 11: šu gub₃-bu-ŋu₁₀ nam-šul AK-AK-<de₃>-[en]
O.17 12: gub₃-bu-ŋu₁₀ nam-*šul! *di-*di-*de₃
NOTE: the sign read as ŠUL appears on the tablet as a sign that looks more like AŠ.NIG₂ or BUR
VAT 3606 obv. 2': [. . .] ŋu₁₀ <*nam>-<*šul> [gi₄]?-<gi₄>? [. . .]
  Compare IEb 56: utug₂-saŋ-7-e zi-da-na nam-šul ba-ni-in-AK, which PSD A/3 114 translates: "the seven-headed mace at her right side showed its youthful strength".

To make those on my left side act vigorously.

13: ul peš!-peš! *ama-*bi *i₃-gi₄-gi₄-de₃
NOTE: the second and third signs on the tablet do not really look like "peš", but it is unclear what other signs they would be. Note also that it is possible that the sign read as "i₃" is "ir" -- the inside of the sign is too worn to see how many vertical wedges were inside it.
L.1501 obv. 12: ul peš!(HA)-peš <x> ama-bi i₃-gi₄-gi₄-<de₃>-[en] 
VAT 3606 obv. 3': <*ul> *peš(GIR)-<*peš> *ama-*bi *i₃-<gi₄>? [. . .]
O.17 13: ul *pe-*pe-*eš *mah-*bi *si?(OR: KU?) *gi-*ir-*gi-*re
NOTE: šu is extremely unlikely, but it is possible that the sign read as "si" is LAGAB or LAGABxU.
  O.17 14: ul pe-pe *pa-<*edin>? *pa(-)*ŠI-*da-še₃(OR: šu?)

To make their mother flush with joy.(?)

14: ama-ŋu₁₀ e₂ ma-an-du₃ ta-e-<am₃> / dam ma-an-ze₂-eŋ₃ ta-e-am₃
L.1501 obv. 13: ama-ŋu₁₀ e₂ ma-an-du₃ te-e-am₃ dam [. . .]
VAT 3606 obv. 4': *ama-*ŋu₁₀ *e₂ *ma-*an-<ku₄>? <te>-*a-*am₃ [. . .]
  NOTE: the sign read as "ku₄" is definitely not "du" or "du₃", but it is not entirely certain that it is "ku₄" either.
O.17 17: *ama-*ŋu₁₀ *a *ma-*du *da-*a-*a *dam *ma-*du *da-*a-*a
  NOTE: it is difficult to determine from the photo whether the sign before "a-a" in the forms in this and the following lines is "ma" or "da" -- if the latter, this could be understood as a phonetic writing of "ta", which would be parallel to ta-e-am₃ "what?", in the other sources. Although ma-a-a "whereto?" is well attested, it typically requires a verb of motion, which does not seem to be present here.
CT 58, p.14 translates this line: "My mother, you have built a house for me, but what does it mean, you have given me a husband, but what does it mean?".

My mother built a house for me - what (has become of it)?; she gave a spouse to me - what (has become of it)?

O.17 21: e₂-bi 30-kam(-)*ma(-)*DU(-)DU(-)da-ka mu <x> [. . .]
NOTE: another possibility (suggested to me by Uri Gabbay) would be to read "e₂-bi eš-ub-aš ku?-du du-da" and interpret this as a phonetic writing of "e₂-bi e₂ šu-peš ki-da du₃-a", which is certainly a possibility. The only difficulty with this interpretation is that the sign read as "ub" has a Winkelhaken or a diagonal wedge inside it, which is rare for UB in this period (which usually has a single vertical wedge inside it), and more typical of "kam"; and more problematically the sign following is almost certainly "ma" and not "AŠ.KU" (compare, for example "ma" in obv. 18 of this source, which is identical in form to this sign, and includes the small horizontal wedge that looks like a truncated AŠ at the beginning of the sign). Assuming that this line is written phonetically, however, another possibility might be to read "e₂-be₂-eš-ub!" as a phonetic writing of "e₂-bi e₂ šu-peš" with a verbal form "ma-DU.DU" following it.

NOTE: "ama" at the end of the first part of the line seems unlikely, and "gin₇" is another possibility, though also an uncertain one.

NOTE: in all the sources that have it, it is really difficult to determine whether the sign after "ni₂" is "zu" or "ba", and it is quite possible that "ba" is a better reading than "zu".

Following CT 58, p.14, this line can be translated: "Mother, mistress, you yourself acted like a woman worth 30 shekels of silver".

  NOTE: the sign after the sign read as "sig" is definitely "ga" and not "bi", and the sign read as "eŋ₃" looks a lot more like "eŋ₃" than "ad", and "sig", while far from certain, is more likely than "gal".
  NOTE: O.17 continues with 5 more lines that are different than the last line in this section of BM 96936, and L.1501 continues with 3 more lines that are different than the line in BM 96936. The first two of these lines in L.1501 are identical to the first two of these lines in O.17, but the last line of L.1501 is different than all three of the last lines of O.17.

*) "Manchester Tammuz" 

** Pinches M(anchester) M(emoirs) (vol. 48, 1904, pl.7) + Vienna 25363 (piece from middle of tablet recopied and published by Civil in NABU 1990, n.20 - cited in transliteration below as "A₂"). One of the many difficulties in transliterating this source is that the signs "ma" and "ba" are essentially indistinguishable both on the copy and what can be read of the photo. Also "di" and "ki" are practically indistinguishable (as was also noted by Alster in ASJ 14, p.8, together with other graphic difficulties specific to this source).

** A: NBC 1315 (RA 16, 208; Bab 3, pl. 15) - note that Langdon's copy is especially bad for the obverse of this tablet (the reverse is a bit better), so many readings are taken directly from Cohen, who seems to have collated the tablet; nonetheless, need to CHECK original. Note also that the source is probably a multi-column tablet (as indicated by traces of signs that seem to belong to lines in the second column of the obverse), see notes to the source above for more details.

It is possible that the signs read as "SU₃.SU₃" are "IM.IM". Note especially that the first "SU₃" in every pair in this line and the next two is far from certain and may be "bar" (though there do seem to be Winkelhaken before the sign that would be "bar" making this less likely).

At this point the tablet seems to have been cut cleanly diagonally so that the beginnings of the last two preserved line and perhaps one or two more entire lines have been cup off completely. If this is the case, then this would mean that the true bottom edge of tablet is also not preserved, making it impossible to determine whether it was also inscribed. In either case, due to the shape of the tablet, it is unlikely that more than one or two lines are missing (and of course the same would also apply to the beginning of the reverse).

Note that the left edge of the tablet is broken in the space that follows the preceding four lines and there may have been 3-4 additional lines in this space.

Note also that there are traces of a colophon containing a line count (only part of the number is preserved [. . .] <x> DIŠ.DIŠ.DIŠ <x>) to the right of this broken space where these lines might have been.

Note: this tablet is also a hand-size landscape tablet - but it contains two columns per side with a wide middle dividing line with 10-mark written on it for the lines in col. ii (on the obverse) and col. iii (on the reverse)

Obv.
col. i
1: [. . .] <x> *a-*ra-*li *me-*en *eŋ₃-*ŋu₁₀ *eŋ₃ *gal-*la-*am₃
2: [. . .] a-ra-li me-en eŋ₃-ŋu₁₀ eŋ₃ gal-la-am₃

5: [. . .] <x> e :: ga-ša-an men₃ gu-nu-ra
  Note: I've noted that there are possibly two Winkelhaken after "e" on the tablet, but that this may also just be an erasure.
6: [. . .] <*KA>? e {d}ŠE.TIR {d}ku₃-su₃-ŋu₁₀ eŋ₃-ŋu₁₀ eŋ₃ gal-la-am₃
7: [. . .] ŋu₁₀ eŋ₃ gal-la me-ŋu₁₀ me gal-la-am₃

9: [. . .] zi-da i-lu ma-al-ma-al-<*la/e>? i-lu-ŋu₁₀ kur₂-ra-am₃
  Note: the sign read as "la/e" is almost certainly not "AŠ₂".
10: [. . .] <*ra>? *GAM? ma-al-ma-al-la na-aŋ₂-tar-ŋu₁₀ kur₂-ra-am₃
  Note: sign read as "gam" consists of two Winkelhaken, as one would expect; but note that throughout the tablet "tar" is often written as if it only had two Winkelhaken.
11: [. . .] <x> <x>-a '' mi-ni-ib-gi₁₆¬-le-eŋ₃ men₃-na-ŋu₁₀

16: [. . .] <x> ma-la-ra <*a₂>? sig₃¬-še₃ ba-ni-ib₂-sig₃-ge-na-ŋu₁₀
  Note: the inside of the sign after "ra" is broken, making it difficult to determine whether it was "a₂", though "a₂" is certainly possible.
17: [. . .] <*ra>? ga-na-ab-du₁₁ in-še₃ mu-un-dub₂-be₂

21: [. . .] <*BU/MI₂>? *IŠ? na-nam bar-ŋu₁₀-uš na-dub₂-be₂
  Note: this sign read as "IŠ" could also be "DU".
22: [. . .] <*na>-nam-<ŋu₁₀> me-na ur₃?-ur₃?-re
  Note: the two signs at the end of the line before "re" are definitely not "ur₃" since they begin with two diagonal slanting wedges (see collation drawing).
23: [. . .] <nu>?-dub-dub-ba na-nam me-na bur₂-bur₂-re
  Note: I've noted that it is possible that the sign read as "nu" is not "nu".
24: [. . .] nu-NE-a-ŋu₁₀-ne
25: [. . .] men₃ nu-*hul₂?-la nu-du₁₁-ga-ŋu₁₀-ne
  Note: the sign read as "hul₂" consists of "ŠI" followed by what looks like "LU" with an extra Winkelhaken or diagonal wedge inside it.

3: <bar>?-ŋu₁₀ al-tar-re al-ma [. . .] 
  Note: if the first sign is "bar" then it is followed by at least two wedges that may belong to a sign that was erased.

  Note: I've noted that the broken sign before "ŋa₂" at the end of the line appears to be wide.

17 (*10-mark): i-bi₂ na-<*an>?-ni-bar-re na-ma-da-ab-be₂ ša₃ im-ta-<ab>?-<e₃>?-<de₃>?
  Note: I've noted that the traces of the sign read as "an" may belong to another sign like "ma". Note also that the traces of the last three signs in the line do not definitely belong to "ab-e₃-de₃" and may be three completely different signs (see collation drawing).

24: na-aŋ₂ *DI.*NE *DIB-*ba i-bi₂-bi <*a₂>? bar-ra KA *mud₅(ŠEM)? *MIN/A

I've also noted that this tablet has the same format as BM 15821, BM 15793, and all of the other hand-sized landscape-format liturgical texts seen during this visit (including the ershemma to Ningirgilu, which is currently on display and which I may not be able to collate and photograph).

"Ershemma no.163.1" (Enlil)

Source A: BM 29644 (CT 15, pl.11-12)
Source B: CBS 15089 obv. col. i (unpublished: CHECK)
Source C: VAT 617 (VS 2, 2, rev. iii l.23-iv l.8) 

The content of the relevant part of source C, which is a collective tablet containing "Ershemma 97 (Inana-Dumuzi)" and this text, is transliterated under this source for that text, but is repeated here for the purpose of providing a score of the text. Source B, which is unpublished, and not available on CDLI, but which seems to contains only the ends of a few of the lines from the middle of this text, is not included here. Since there are two first millennium sources (K.11174 and Rm. 272), included by Cohen, as sources for "Ershemma 163.2", which contain Akkadian translations for some of the more difficult lines in this texts these Akkadian translations are added to the score below for the relevant lines.

See Fritz 2003: 177 for this text and the occurrence of this expression in it. However, since the same expression also occurs in Elum Gusun l.62-74, an Enlil lament, the occurrence of an gu-la and {d}mu-ul-lil₂ instead of Damu (as in BM 96112) are further evidence that this is an Enlil lament.

&&BM 120100 : unpublished, multi-column (probably 4-column) lament, with multiple sections - almost certainly a balag. Very little of the tablet was transliteration in the museum, but the collation photos are good and can be used to transliterate much of the preserved part of the text.

--------------------

UET 6/140 (U.16861): single column tablet 12.6cm in height and 6.2cm in width, recopied and collated by Ludwig, who argues, contrary to previous editors, that the tablet is OB in date and not 1st millennium. She argues that some of the sign forms are archaizing and that a number of signs, like "gal" and "kul", are unusual, comparing some of the idiosyncracies to UET 6/188 and possibly also UET 6/27. In favor of an OB date are the likelihood that the tablet was found in No. 1 Broad St. (though it could be from a later, NB level), and against it is the writing tu₂-kul(UD.HI) for "tukul", values which only occur in later texts. See also Cavigneaux JAOS 113 (1993): 251f. for a similar argument for an OB date.

end of reverse of fragment

(Note: if this fragment really does belong to the same tablet as VAT 604, then there cannot be many missing lines between where the main part of column ii ends and the lines on this fragment begin, judging from the way the tablet edge tapers when lined up with the tablet edge of the main piece of the tablet).

--------------------

&&VAT 605 + (VS 2, 8) = Cohen Source W

col. i
it is not possible to determine how many lines are broken before the beginning of column if this piece (A₁) belongs to the same tablet as VAT 605+. The signs at the ends of the lines after the break are from another flake (given here the siglum A₂) that contains the ends of lines in this column and the beginnings of lines in col. ii. Since A₂ does nearly physically join "A₁" around 6'-7', it is relatively certain to which lines the signs in this tablet belong.
1' (A₁): [. . .] *eŋ₃ [. . .]
2': [. . .] <*du₆>-<*du₆>-<*dam>? <*gi/zi>? [. . .]

  Note: lines 1'-14' are from a piece that not physically join the tablet - this piece will be refered to with the siglum "A₁". Note also that A₂ has traces of the end of the sign in another line, labeled 14a, so that old line numbering of tablet does not have to be changed.
14a': [. . .] A₂ <*ta>
*Break of uncertain number of lines - Note that since neither A₁ or A₂ seem to physically join the main tablet for this source (referred to with the siglum "MS"), it is unclear whether there is a break between where these pieces end and the next part of the tablet begins, and if so, how many line are missing in this break. Given that the end of these fragments and the beginning of MS both end with lines ending in "ta", the break was probably not too large.

Fragment A₂ ends here, uncertain how many lines are broken between this fragment and the lines in the main part of the tablet.

Note there is also another tiny edge fragment which seems to contain the ends of lines from the beginning col. ii and the end of col. iii, which must belong somewhere in this part of the tablet. It is very probable that some of these lines are the ends of lines in A₂. The transliteration of col. ii of this source, labelled "A₄", is as follows:

  Note: the rest of the column is broken in the main source from this line on. But there is a right corner pieces, referred to here with the siglum A₃, which directly joins the column and has the continuation of the column until the end. The only point that is uncertain is whether the sign read as <x> in the main tablet in 50a' is part of a separate line before the text continues with A₃ or whether it belongs to the second part of l.50'.

  Note: "NE" seems fairly certain, the sign after "sig" seems more likely to be "maš₂" than "gi", though "gi" or another sign are possible, and there is definitely another sign between "KU" and "ta" which could be a very squeezed "e". For the signs after "SIG", see collation drawing.

  Note: it is possible, though far from certain, that there was another sign in the break between <aŋ₂> and <LU>, and since there are possible traces of a small Winkelhaken at the end of the horizontal wedge inside the second to last sign, it is possible that this sign is a tightly squeezed, defective "da" instead of "ba", which without this Winkelhaken the sign nonetheless resembles.

SKL Commentary p.77: Pairs of lines that are identical, or identical except for the addition of an elaborative phrase are common. Cf. This text col. ii l.44f.; CBS 3656 (BE 30, 2), l.38f.; VS 2, 5: 36f.; Ur Lament l.1f., and CT 15, 13: 1f.
  še--ša₄ = damaamu 'to moan' is very common. See p.78 for words with which it occurs (pigeons, door hinges, marsh and thicket, rivers, the sea, storms, and possibly also bulls).
  me-e p.78: common ES form for pronoun "I". Notes also that me-e may sometimes alternate with me-a which may have a heavier intonation than me-e; it should also be kept in mind, however, that me-e/a can also be an interrogative pronoun meaning "how?" or "where?". Examples of ma-a for me-e/a include BM 88383 (CT 15, 30) l.4 which is parallel to BM 23658 (CT 15, 26) rev. l.1. 
  The -an- in the verbal form SKL (p.79) interprets as a form of -am₃-, which would allow for the pre-verbal element to be /b/, which is what would be needed if the verbal form is maru (the -e not being written because ša₄ ends with a vowel), but this seems very improbable. 

3: [še-eb] e₂-kur!-ra-ri e₂ zi-de₃ / še-eb e₂-kur-ra
  The brickwork of the Ekur, the true house; the brickwork of the Ekur <<it moans, I moan with it>>
  cf. VAT 605+ (VS 2, 8), i 12: e₂-kur-re ša₃-ge pad₃-da : "The Ekur, the house that is called to the heart" (SKL p.81)
4: [ki-ur₃] ki gal-la e₂ zi-de₃ ki-ur₃ ki / gal-la
  The Kiur, the great place, the true house; the Kiur, the great place <<it moans, etc.>>

  The Ekamah, the true house; the Ekamah <<it moans...>>
6: [ŋa₂-nun] <mah>-ri e₂ zi-de₃ / [. . .] <x> ŋa₂-nun mah-ri
  The Ganunmah, the true house; the Ganunmah <<it moans...>>
  -- ŋa₂-nun mah = "the great storehouse"; cf. Akk. ganuunu. Note that this can also occur with the ES writing ma-nun (mah).
7: [ma-ŋiš]-<šu₂>-a-ri e₂ zi-de₃ / ma-<ŋiš>-šu₂-a-ri
  The Magishua, the true house; the Magishua <<it moans...>>
  -- ES for ŋa₂-ŋiš-šu₂-a, one of Ninlil's shrines at Nippur. SKL p.83 considers the possibility that ŋiš-šu₂ = ereebu ša šamaš "place where the sun sets"
8: [ma e₂] gal mah-ri <e₂> <zi>-<de₃> / ma e₂-gal <mah> [. . .]
  The Maegalmah, the true house; the Maegalmah <<it moans...>>
  -- SKL p.83 cf. VAT 604+ i. 30: ma-e₂-gal-mah ki di gal-bi kur₂-ru "House, Egalmah, the place where great verdicts are decided".
9: [du₆ ku₃] ki ku₃-ri e₂ zi <de₃> / [. . .] <du₆> ku₃ ki ku₃-ri
  The Dukukiku, the true house; the Dukukiku <<it moans...>>

11: [še-eb uru₂] saŋ-ŋa₂ e₂ zi-de₃ še-eb / uru₂ saŋ-ŋa₂-ri
  The brickword of the main city, the true house; the brick work of the main city <<>>
  -- SKL 84-85 long discussion of why uru₂ saŋ is taken to mean "main city", together with parallels. Note also that on p.84 Krecher gives syllabic writings of uru₂ as u₂-ru and u₂-ra (with locative) in TLB 2, 6 (among others).
12: <e₂> <tir> <ku₃>-ga-ri e₂ zi-de₃ / e₂ tir ku₃ <x> [. . .]

15: [. . .] <ra>?-ak-a-ri e₂ zi-de₃ / še-eb la-ra-ak-a-ri
  The brickwork of Larak, the true housel the brickwork of Larak <<>>
  -- for Larak, SKL 86f. - occurs in Ur Lament in sequence with Isin, Uruk, Ur, and Eridu  before Umma, Uruk, and Lagash.

Commentary SKL pp.80f.
 -ri: interpreted as an isolating particle. Assumes that the instances in which it is omitted are mistakes. Although it could refer to the name of the temple in each case, Krecher considers the possibility that it refers to the verbal form in lines 1-2: še am₃-da-an-ša₄, so that these lines would read TN [it moans]
 - p.81 - notes that the same temple names occur in CBS 3656 (col. i, 3-10), albeit in a slight different order:

  -de₃ in e₂ zi-de₃ intepreted to contain "-a" concealed by "e" (p.81).

16: [še-eb] e₂ zi-da-ka mu-bi ir₂-re / am₃-ma-ni-in-ma-al
  At the wood of the brickwork of the true house, there is lamenting.
  Or: The man at the brickwork of the true house is put to lamenting.
  Or: The wood of the brickwork of the true house is put to lamenting.
17: eš₃ <e₂> <gal> mah-a gi-bi ir₂-re / am₃-ma-ni-in-ma-al
  At the reed of the shrine, the Egalmah, there is lamenting.
  The same two possible alternate translations hold for this line, with gi-bi possibly refering to "the woman at the shrine, the Egalmah"

Commentary SKL:
-- note that Krecher (p.87 with n.217) translates the pair mu-bi and gi-bi as "man" and "woman" on the basis of the parallel passage in CT 42, 26 rev. 5f. where the two terms are translated with Akkadian eṭlu and ardatue, and equivalence which may also be attested in ES vocabulary II 71 (although the equivalence for ge-e for ardatu is almost entirely reconstructed). Krecher is aware of the possibility that mu and gi = wood and reed, but he rules it out (p.88) without giving any reasons.
-- SKL 89: Krecher translates ir₂-re--ma-al as "in Weinen gesetzt" taking the "e" in ir₂-re as the loc.-term. 


18: i-si-iš am₃-ta-la₂-la₂ i-bi₂-bi-ta / i-si-iš am₃-ta-la₂-la₂
  (At its front) moaning is suspended - at its front moaning is suspended.
  Or: Moaning hangs, in front of it moaning hangs.
19: še-eb e₂ zi-da-ka ša₃-bi a-še-er / im-ši-la₂-la₂
  From the interior of the brickwork of the true house grief is suspended.

Commentary SKL 89f.:
  -- these lines occur in almost identical form in VAT 1338+ (VS 2, 5) col. iii 45f. and the first millennium parallel text SBH 17, l.15 and 17 where i-si-iš is translated with nissatu and la₂ with itta'lal - a form of alaalu = 'to hang, be suspended'. Note also that a-še-er is translated with taaniihu = 'sighing'. SKL 91-92 a-še-er is the ES form of a-nir: 'lament'. Note also the literal translation of i-bi₂-bi-ta i-si-iš am₃-ta-la₂-la₂ "an dessen Augen haengen Traenen" (SKL 91).

20: nu-mu-ni-in-dib-be₂ mu-lu hul₂-la-na / nu-mu-ni-in-dib-be₂
  He does not cross over it, when one is happy, (he) does not cross over it.
21: <e₂>? <x> mah-a mu-lu li-ba-ni / nu-mu-ni-in-dib-be₂
  Over the Egalmah, when one is rejoicing, (he) does not cross over it.

Commentary SKL 93f.
  -- these lines occur in almost identical form in VAT 1338+ col. iii 47f. (SKL 93-94) except that mu-lu is replaced with lu₂.
  -- dib = LAGABxPA = ba'u and alaaku = 'to go', 'to cross over' (SKL 94), noting that there are syllabic spellings di-ib for dib in similar contexts (BE 30, 5 ii 11 and TLB 2, 6 iii 8f., among others).
  -- LI-(b) = SKL 96, cites MSL 3, 114: 302 = li-i LI = ra-a-<šu> (to rejoice) in support of the reading li(b) and the translation "rejoicing" here. Another Akkadian translation is the synonymous haduu. Gives other examples of hul₂ and li(b) occurring in apposition.

22: e₂ zi-de₃ mu-lu eŋ₃-da-mar-re-en / ir₂ nu-mu-ni-ib-gul-e
  One who ... at the true house does not stop lamenting.
23: e₂ zi-de₃ ga-ša-an-bi ir₂ bi₂-in-pad₃ / ir₂ nu-mu-ni-ib-gul-e
  The mistress of the true house begins to lament (and) does not stop lamenting.
  Or: On account of the true house its mistress began to cry, she did not hold back tears (and similar for the preceding line)

Commentary SKL 96f.
  -- these lines occur in almost identical form in VAT 1338+ l.49f. (SKL 96-97). As in the preceding lines the parallels with PRAK C 32 also continue.
  -- note the Akkadian translation bakaa ul ikalla ('he does not stop/hold back whining') in the 1st mill. parallel text SBH 36, l.16 and 18.
  -- SKL 97: ir₂--pad₃ translated 'Traenen hervorbringen'.
  -- SKL 97: "e" in e₂ zi-de₃ taken as loc.-term. and translated "on account of the true house (its mistress began to cry)". 
  -- SKL 97: gul as kallu 'to hold back' seems very reasonable.
  -- SKL 98: Krecher finds the -en in the form eŋ₃-da-mar-re-en problematic and noting that it does not occur in the parallel passage in VAT 1338+ emends the text to omit it. For this line VAT 1338+ has: e₂ zi-da mu-lu am₃-da-ŋar-ra <ir₂> [nu]-mu-ni-gul-e. SKL 98f. attempts to make sense of the difficult form am₃-da-ŋar... as a shortened form of saŋ -- ŋar 'rush toward' remain unconvincing.

24: ga-ša-an-bi ir-ra na-aŋ₂ e₂ pe-el-la₂ / e-ne-še₃ mu-un-ma-ma
  That woman is carried away, the fate of the defiled house is established for her.
25: ga-ša-an i₃-si-in-na na-aŋ₂ uru₂ / i-ra-na e-ne-še₃ mu-un-ma-ma
  (For) Ninisina the fate of her plundered city is established for her.
26: na-aŋ₂ e₂ pe-el-la₂ uru₂ i-ra-na / e-ne-še₃ mu-un-ma-ma
  The fate of her defiled house, her plundered city is established for her.

Commentary SKL 100f.
  -- SKL 100: a litany with the form na-aŋ₂ -- a also occurs in the Ur Lament 82-85 = 311-314.
  -- SKL 100f.: the form e-ne-še₃ mu-un-ma-ma is acknowledged to be difficult. Krecher rejects the possibility that e-ne-še₃ means "to him/her" on account of the syntactic position of e-ne and because -ra would be expected in place of -še₃ with an animate pronoun. He considers the possibility that it is a syllabic writing for i₃-ne-še₃ 'now' and 'there', but rejects it as improbable, favoring the interpretaion of e-ne as a-na 'was' or 'wie', and then further as me-na "until when/how long" (which seems equally improbable) instead. A possibility that is not considered is that e-ne serves as a type of reflexive pronoun, to be translated "made herself cry". This would go well semantically with Krecher's interpretation of na-aŋ -- a as "on account of", yielding the translation: "On account of her plundered city and defiled house Ninisina made herself cry". 
  -- SKL 101-102 notes the understanding of i-ra as the ES form of tum₂ = "to carry (away)", which is now generally accepted.
  -- SKL 102f. considers the possibility that the difficult na-aŋ₂ -- a is parallel to the expression nam -- še₃ = "on account of". In favor of this reading, the 1st mill. text SBH 35: 18 translates the expression na-aŋ₂ e₂-pe-el-la₂ as aššum biitišu šulputu = "on account of his defiled house".
  -- SKL 103: notes that Ninisina is equated with Gula in ES vocabulary I 97 and reads the "LU" in the ES name of the deity Nintinuga as "u₉" = {d}ga-ša-an-tin-u₉-ba.
  -- SKL 103-104: the senseless discussion of the variant writings of Ninisina's name with the signs -in-si instead of i₃-si-in is noted.

27: traces sag₂(PA.GAN) du₁₁-ga-na / e-ne-še₃ mu-un-ma-ma

Commentary to 27-28, SKL 104f.
  -- SKL 104f. cites parallels to verbs sag₂--du₁₁ and tu₁₁(b) occurring in apposition.
  -- SKL 106f. discusses the meaning of tu₁₁(HUB₂) as to "heap into a pile", citing at least one instance in which tu₁₁ is translated with Akkadian kamaaru. He notes, however, that the same verb can also mean 'beat' or 'strike'.

  The lady, Ninisina, said:

Commentary SKL 107f.
 -- first sign SAL+TUG₂ is different than sign for "nin" in the name of the goddess Ninlil, which is written consistently SAL+MA. The original writing of egi₂ was SAL+ŠE₃ (p.108). egi₂ = rubaatu = "princess". Possibly connect with gi₇(KU) = "prince" in dumu-gi₇ and other expressions. 

2: e₂-a-na gam-ma-ni mu-un-di-di / ir₂ gig mu-un-še₈-še₈
  Bowed down she moves about in her house and whines bitter tears.
3: <ama₅> pe-<el>-<la₂> mu-un-di-di / ir₂ gig mu-un-še₈-še₈
  She moves about in her defiled cultic chamber and whines bitter tears.

Commentary SKL 108f.
-- two lines directly paralleled by Ni 2922 (SLTN 103) rev. l.2-3:
  2: e₂-a-ni gurum(GAM)-ma-ni mu-di-di-in / ir₂ gig mu-še₈-še₈
  3: ama₅ pe-el-la-na mu-di-di-in ir₂ gig mu-še₈-še₈
-- p.109 translates di-di as daalu = "to roam, go around (without a goal)"  
-- p.110: ama₅ = maštakku = "Frauen-Wohnstaette". Occurs in Gudea Cylinder B v 10-15 in a context which clearly denotes a sleeping chamber.

4: <IM>? ma/ba? ma-al-la ba?-ma? u₃-na gibil-la-bi im-me
  ... to be ... she says again and again (lit. newly)
5: ga-ša-an i₃-si-in-na men₃ {d}mu-ul-lil₂-la₂ / me-na-še₃ ur₅-ra-bi am₃-me
  "I, Ninisina, how long should I speak thusly to Enlil?"

Commentary SKL 112f.
-- 112f.: notes that these lines are parallel to AO 7684 (TCL 16, 41):
  4: ŋa₂/ma-ra ta me-ma-al gibil-la₂-<bi> [am₃-me]
  5: {d}mu-ul-lil₂ me-na-še₃ ur₅-ra-bi <am₃>-[me] - restored on basis of parallel in VAT 1337+ (VS 2, 7)
  "What has happened to me?" she says again and again."
  "Oh, Enlil, how much longer?" she says thusly."
-- gibil-la₂-bi am₃-me = to say, "immer wieder von neuen" (SKL 112)
-- because of parallel, Krecher (p.114) interprets {d}mu-ul-lil₂-la₂ as a vocative, in spite of the "a", leading to a translation along the lines of "I, Ninisina, how much longer should I say 'Oh, Enlil'". rendering ur₅-ra-bi (instead of the expected ur₅-re-bi) as "als Einziges", "in Einem fort".

---------- double dividing line on tablet ---------
6: u₃-a erimx(URU₂)-ma-ŋu₁₀ u₃-a erimx-ma-ŋu₁₀
  Krecher reads uru₂ as "erimx", which makes sense with the "m" Auslaut.
  Woe, my treasure house, woe, my treasure house
7: u₃-a erimx-ma-ŋu₁₀ mu-lu šir₃-ra u₃-a erimx-ma-ŋu₁₀
  Woe, my treasure house - the one of song - woe, my treasure house.

Commentary SKL 114f.
  -- 114f. different writings for "u₃-a", the cry 'woe' are listed.
  -- 115f.: erim₃ = išittu = 'treasure house', written syllabically in PRAK C 66 as "i-ri-ma"
  -- 117: the insertion of mu-lu šir¬₃-ra poses problems, since Ninisina seems to be the one speaking. Krecher thus takes it to be a vocative and has Ninisina addressing the singer, who is repeating her words in the performance. Shehata's recent book is likely to have a more detailed discussed of lu₂-šir₃-ra, which is also attested in lexical lists and probably has some connection with the gala-priest.
  -- 117-119: noting that some of the people in the next few lines are marked with -e and some are not, but all are apparently in the vocative, Krecher renews the discussion of whether the vocative can also occur with "-e" sometimes, without providing a good explanation for the inconsistency. 
  -- Note the assumption that in the following lines a speaker change has taken place and now the mu-lu šir₃-ra is speaking in a kind of call and response, where the deity in each line is announced in the vocative and is answered, by another singer with line 7: "woe, my treasure house...".

-- SKL 120-121: sa₁₂-du/du₅ = šassukkatu = "Katasterleiter(in)"
-- SKL 121f. discussion of the name for Nintinugu, interpreted as "mistress of life and death", where "tin" would have to be a rare form of "ti(l)" = 'life', possibly confirmed by some ES syllabic writings of the name with -ti-lu-ba.
-- SKL 123 - Gunura is the daughter of Ninisina.
-- SKL 124f. - TUM.DIB ku₃ appears only to be attested as the name of a goddess here.
-- SKL 125f. - interprets the deity Enanun as another name for Gula. In some god lists Pabilsag is listed as her husband.
-- SKL 126f. - discussion of gu₃-an-ne₂-si, which Krecher interprets literally, without considering the possibility that it is to be read kurku₂ = wish or flood wave, especially since at least four sources write the phrase syllabically as kur-ku. Probably Sjoeberg's discussion of this term had not appeared yet.
-- SKL 128f. - very long discussion of the meaning of the name ga-ša-an-niŋin₃-mar-ra, including a list of many of the syllabic writings of this name.
-- SKL 131f. - discussion of the name ga-ša-an-aš-te. The problem here is that Pabilsag is the patron deity of Larak, but Pabilsag is usually the husband of Ninisina, in contradiction to ga-ša-an-aš-te being his husband.
-- SKL 132f. - discussion of the name Ezinu-Kusu. Note that syllabic writings in parallel passages such as e-zi-na, suggest that ŠE.TIR is to be read "Ezinu" and not Ašnan. Kusu and Ezinu (Akkadian Ashnan) may originally have been separate deities, but they are often directly connected in Sumerian literary sources.

-- 136: translates za-gin₃ as "shining" with Ekur.
-- 136: l.24 restored on basis of SBH 52: 19. Also argues that ŋa₂ like ma can be the ES word for e₂ 'house'.
-- 137: buluŋ written syllabically as bu-lu-ka-ki in VS 2, 48, l.10. Possibly the equivalent of Akkadian pulukku. 137-138 lengthier commentary to buluŋ.

38: ma erimx-ma-ŋu¬₁₀ mu-lu im-ta-e¬₃ mu-lu nu-KU-MU
  My treasure house which a person leaves, a person does not seize.

Commentary SKL 141f.
-- 142f.: parallel lines occur in RA 17, 50: 9-11, where ur, mi-re, and mu-lu all occur in sequence with the verb e₃. Note also that the three words also that the first two words also occur in sequence in STVC 83 col. ii 36f. where Inana is wishing for these entities to return to the temple, suggesting that there presence in the temple is desirable. However, in HAV 3: 9-11 = VS 10, 176: 5-7 the sequence tumušen, mušen, and mu-lu occur in a similar context. For this and other (not entirely convincing) reasons suggests that the pair ur and mi-re = gir₂ might refer to the animals dog and scorpion, but the passage remains difficult. 

39: erimx-ma-ŋu₁₀ sahar ba-da-dub-dub sahar ba-da-šu₂-šu₂
  My treasure house, heaped up with dirt, covered with dirt.

Commentary SKL 144: notes parallels with later bilinguals where dub-dub and šu₂-šu₂ are translated with tabaaku and šapaaku and sahar is translated with eperu (dirt, earth) - well known equivalences.

40: erimx-ma-ŋu₁₀ IŠ.GAR i₇-da-ke₄ šu am₃-ši-ni₁₀-ni₁₀
  My treasure house, collected like the ... of the river.

Commentary SKL 144f.: notes that in parallel in SBH 50a rev. 12f. IŠ.GAR i₇-da-gin₇ is translated with Akkadian ša₂-b/pi-ik na-a-ri from shapaaku, yielding a translation along the lines of "Hingeschuettetes".
-- 145: Krecher's reading of the "-e" in -ke₄ as a form of gin₇, however, seems rather dubious.
-- 145: translates šu--niŋin as "sich sammeln", although niŋin = samaaku = to collect would probably be better for this meaning.

------- double dividing line on tablet --------
41: egi₂-re a ša₃-ni a bar-ra-ni
  Lady, woe, her heart, woe, her soul.

Commentary SKL 145f.: the pair a ša₃-ŋu₁₀ a bar-ŋu₁₀ occurs in Inana's Descent and is translated in a later bilingual as u'a libbii u'a kabattaa.
-- 146: Krecher again takes the "-e" in egi₂-re as a vocative.

------- double dividing line on tablet --------
42: ša₃-ab ir₂-re a-še-er-re al-kuš₂-u₃-a-ŋu₁₀
  My heart which crying and sighing tire out.
43: ga-ša-an i₃-si-in-na ir₂ i₃-si-in-na-ke₄ / al-kuš₂-u₃-a-ŋu₁₀
  My Ninisina which the crying of Isin tires out.
  Or, with Krecher: Oh Ninisina, (my heart) which the crying for Isin tires out.
------- double dividing line on tablet --------
44: <edin>-e i-lu-a u₄ mu-ni-ib-zal-e
  She passes the day lamenting in the steppe.
  Or: The steppe passes the day lamenting.
45: i-lu-a <edin> i-lu-a u₄ mu-ni-ib-zal-e
  In lamenting, the steppe passes the day in lamenting.

Commentary SKL 148f.
-- Note that Krecher treats ii 44-iii 32 as a single unit which is understood to have an unwritten repeating refrain after each line.
-- 148-149: notes already that i-lu is neutral with respect to whether it is a cry of lament or joy. See now Shehata 2009 for a more detailed discussion of this term.

46: sa₁₂-du an-na ga-ša-an i₃-si-in-na

  The Arali ...
49: ŋa₂ <balaŋ>-ŋa₂ <x> ŋar nun-na-ri

Commentary SKL 151f.:
-- these lines are restored on the basis of col. iv 47-49 = vi 1-3, which are also parallel to PRAK D 45: 2-5.
-- 151: balks at translating gu₂-bar-ur₃-ra.

50: ŋa₂-gi₄-a e₂-saŋ tur-ra-ri
  The closter?, the little storehouse

Commentary SKL 152f.
-- Line occurs in iv 51 = vi 5 and is parallel to PRAK D 45: 6.
-- 152: notes that equivalence between ŋa₂-gi₄-a and Akk. gaguu.
-- 152-153: even though e₂-saŋ is consistently translated with Akk. ešreetu = shrine, on the basis of a passage in which the term occurs in connection with storing up grain Krecher concludes it must mean something like storehouse here.
-- 153: acknowledges that the connection between a closter and a storehouse is difficult to explain.

51: <rig₇> TUR.TUR-na <ub> nun-na-ri
   ... the princely corner

Commentary SKL 153f.
-- Line occurs in iv 52 = vi 6 and is parallel to PRAK D 45: 7.
-- 153-154: argues that "rig₇" can mean an enclosed space, possibly qaritum = "barn" or the like.
-- 154: TUR.TUR with an "n-Auslaut" is otherwise unknown and only seems to work if it is understood to be short for TUR.ZA/TUR.ZA = zazna = "puppet" or TUR.DIŠ = gina = "little or weak one", but this seems like a bit of a stretch.

52: <ma>-mu-ni-in-<bar> tur-tur-ra-ri
  The house of the little date palm trees.

Commentary SKL 154f.
-- Line occurs in iv 53 (but not in vi 1f.) and is parallel to PRAK D 45: 8 = PRAK B 322: 6 = PRAK C 25: 2.
-- 154: considers possibility that mu-ni-in-bar is the ES form of ŋiš-nim-bar = gišimmar = date palm, but this seems unlikely.

53: [a-ra]-<li> [. . .] <am₃>-nu₂-a-ri
  The Arali ... lying down.
54: [a-ra-li? egi₂? na x bi kur-e al-gi₄?-gi¬₄?-a-ri]

Commentary SKL 155:
-- 155: all these lines restored on the basis of PRAK D 45: 9-10, which is also not particularly well preserved.


55: [egi₂ a-ra-li ama nu-a-ri a-a nu-a-ri]
  Oh princess, the Arali in which the mother lies down, the father lies down.
56: [a-ra-li ki-sikil nu-a-ri ŋuruš nu-a-ri]
  The Arali where the maiden lies down, where the young man lies down.
57: [a-ra-li dumu nin₉ nu-a-ri dumu šeš nu-a-ri]
  The Arali where the child of the sister lies down, the child of the brother lies down.
 
Commentary SKL 155f.:
-- 155: lines restored on the basis of iv 9-11 and parallel in PRAK D 45: 11-13.
-- 156: notes that the syllabic writing "nu" for "nu₂" is typical of texts from Kish, but that in this text "nu" only occurs for "nu₂" with non-finite verbal forms.

col. iii
1: [. . .] <ta>? am₃-nu₂
  Krecher restores: [mes mes-e an]-<ta> am₃-nu₂
  Men lay down on top of other men.

Commentary SKL 157f.:
-- restored on the basis of col vi 12 = PRAK D 45: 14, etc.
-- 157: similar line attested in Curse of Agade.
-- 157: an-ta interpreted as a derivation from "from above" in the sense of "next to" here.
-- 157-158: mes interpreted as eṭlu = young man, but this is also acknowledged to be uncertain.

2: <an> <edin>-<na> <uri₃> uri₃-na an-ta na-mu-un-DU   
  In the high steppe, blood flows on top of blood.

Commentary SKL 158f.:
-- restored on basis of col. vi 13 = PRAK D 45: 15, etc.
-- 158: evidence presented that ŠEŠ = uri₃, and that uri₃ has an n-Auslaut and means "blood".

3: uri₃ mu-lu [lul]-<la> mu-lu zi-ra an-ta na-mu-DU
  The blood of the lying man flows on top of the blood of the righteous man.

Commentary SKL 159:
-- restored on basis of col. vi 14 = PRAK D 45: 16, etc.

4: uri₃-na e ba-<an>-bu-ra KA šu? am₃-ši-ni₁₀-ni₁₀
  The blood ...

  In the high steppe ...

Commentary SKL 159:
-- lines correspond to col. vi 15-16, PRAK D 45: 17f., etc., but Krecher leaves this line mostly uncommented, except for considering the possibility that "e" = 'dike'.

6: za-gin₃-gin₇ gi [. . .]
  Like lapis lazuli ... 
7: URUDU za-gin₃-gin₇ sahar-ra am₃-<DU>?
  Like shining bronze ... in the dust.
8: ar₂-mu-ra sahar-ra am₃-dul
  ... is covered in dirt.

Commentary SKL 159f.
-- lines correspond to col. vi 17-19 and possibly also PRAK C 100: 4f.
-- 160: speculates about ar₂-mu-ra corresponding to ar₂-mur-ra which may occur in a parallel in Ur Lament 288 and 290 meaning something like "ruin hill", where ar₂ = karmu = 'waste land', which is only attested lexically and is also very speculative.

9: ugula(PA) a₂-aŋ₂-ŋa₂-ni am₃-nu₂
  The supervisor and his commandees lie down.
10: nu-banda₃ erin₂-na-<ni> am₃-nu₂
  The overseer and his work force lie down.

Commentary SKL 160:
-- lines partially correspond to PRAK C 100: 7-8, but no longer to lines in col. vi. Other than having to interpret a₂-aŋ₂-ŋa₂-ni as a substantive the lines are unproblematic. 

11: a-ra-li u₃-mu-<un>-<si>-gal UN-e an-KU.KU
  The steppe ... the great ensi ... the people.

Commentary SKL 160f.
-- line partially corresponds to PRAK C 100: 9
-- 161: Krecher hesitates to interpret the verb KU.KU here.

12: za₃ al-e₃ <ki>-<sikil> tur-ra za₃ al-e₃
  Coming out in front?, the small young maidens come out in front?
13: gu₂ bar ur₃-ra <x> ŋuruš tur-ra TUG₂? eŋ₃-AK?-da
  At the outside of the neck? the small young men ...

Commentary SKL 161:
-- possible parallel PRAK C 100: 10f.
-- 161: notes that za₃--e₃ is otherwise unattested as a compound verb. In n.461, though, he does give the lexical evidence that za₃-e₃ as a noun means ašaredu = "foremost".
-- 161: nothing could be done with "gu₂-bar-ur₃-ra" or the rest of these lines. 

14: šir₃-saŋ šir₃ <mah>?-ni ba-da-<DU>
  The head singer ... his lofty song.
15: balaŋ-di balaŋ-<ŋa₂>-ni ba-da-<DU>
  The balag singer ... his lament

Commentary SKL 161f.
-- possible parallel PRAK C 100: 12f.
-- 162: acknowledges that šir₃-saŋ and balaŋ-di have to refer to people in these lines, but does not interpret the verb "DU".

16: šir₃ saŋ gal-zu-ni [. . .] DU-a-ri IGI.<UM>? <IGI>? [. . .]
  The head singer, his expertise ...
17: balaŋ-di <x> <ba>? balaŋ-ŋa₂-ni-še₃ šu ba-an-<ti>? / i₃-nu₂
  The balag singer ... at his lament ... he lies down.

Commentary SKL 163:
-- other than to point out the parallel with PRAK C 100: 14f. and that gal-zu usually means knowledge or wisdom, nothing else is said about these lines.

27: u₃-<u₈>-a ŋa₂-e uru₂ hul-a-ŋu₁₀ [. . .]
  Woe to me and my destroyed city ...

Commentary SKL 164: little said.

28: ka-na-aŋ₂ i₃-lu-lu MU NE <x> [. . .]
  The land ... woe ...

Commentary SKL 164:
-- notes parallel with CT 42, 19: 24 - ga-nam i₃-lu-lu ga-nam i₃-lu-lu, where the possibility is considered that ga-nam is a syllabic writing of ka-an-aŋ₂ instead of meaning "truly".
29: <uru₂> al-e₃-a me-e <al> [. . .]
  The ones who come out from? the city, I ...
30: <uru₂> al-nu₂ al-nu₂ me-e <al>-di-di <di>-<in>
  In the city that lies down, lies down I roam around. 

Commentary SKL 164:
-- uru₂ in both lines interpreted as "city-dwellers" instead of as "city". SRT 40: 15 - uru₂-bi e₃-a ki-tuš-bi kar-ra 'its city dwellers leave, and its cultic places are abandoned' is cited as a parallel.

31: uru₂ ša₃-ab-ba-na uru₂ bar-ra-na [. . .] <x>
  In the interior of his city, on the outside of his city ...

Commenary SKL 165: 
-- parallel SBH 27: 7f. cited  with an Akkadian translation, but the crucial signs at the beginning of the line are broken. The inside and outside of the city also occur in apposition in Ur Lament 261f. But the plene writing -ab-ba-na is left unexplained.

32: a ŋa₂-e me-e nam-tar-<bi>-<še₃> [. . .]
  Woe to me, I ... on account of its fate.

Commentary SKL 166:
-- SBH 27: 11f. has the line [. . .] na-aŋ₂-tar-bi-še₃ u₃ nu-mu-un-ši-ku-ku : "on account of its fate I cannot sleep", which may provide a possible restoration for the end of this line.

  Oh temple, when I see (it), tears ...
34: eŋ₃? ga-ša-an i₃-si-in <x> [. . .]

Commentary SKL 166:
-- Krecher prefers e₂ ši-ma-al = "city which has life", but this makes just as little sense as igi--ŋal₂.

  Lamenter, my treasure house, ... like an enemy.

Commentary SKL 168f.:
-- restored on the basis of SBH 46: 17f.: note the Akkadian translation in this line: ina ṣirhi išittii ana nakri ittaškan = "amidst lamentation my storehouse has been made hostile against me", which serves as the basis for Krecher's translation of this line, even though he acknowledges that the later parallel has probably misunderstood the line.

41: bad₃-si-bi ba-ra-gul tu!(UZ)mušen-bi <am₃>-[niŋin]
  Its upper walls are destroyed; its pigeons? fly about.

Commentary SKL 169f.:
-- This and the following lines are paralleled by VAT 1337+ (VS 2, 7) and VAT 3702 (VS 10, 127), two sources for Utugin. See also the commentary and translation of these lines in Loehnert's book and the citation of these lines in her article in the Oxford Handbook of Cuneiform Culture. Some of the individual lines are also paralleled in the first millennium bilingual sources SBH 36 and 46. For a useful score of all the parallels for this and the following lines see Loehnert 2009: 266-268 and note that there are often enough differences between the OB and 1st mill. versions of these lines that caution should be used in using a later parallel to smooth over a difficulty in the OB version(s) of the text.
-- 169: bad₃-si translated in the later parallel has siitu. In Gudea Cyl. A col. 29, 7 it is described as a place where pigeons sit.

42: mu-ka₂-na-bi ba-ra-si-il u₆-di-<bi> / ba-gul
  Its door frame is ripped out; all admiration for it is destroyed.

Commentary SKL 170f.:
-- ŋiš-ka₂-na translated into Akkadian as giškanakku. lit. "wood of the door". Quite probably the door frame - the wood around the gate.

43: ŋiš-ur₃-bi mu-lu u₃-mu-un-e <tu₁₁>-ba-<gin₇> / <u₄>-de₃ ba-KU.KU
  Its roof, like one who has been struck by a lord, lies down in full daylight?

Commentary SKL 171f.:
-- 172: "ku" taken as 'to throw (down)' or 'to lay', from its Akkadian equivalent in the later 1st mill. source = ittanduu (from N stem of nadu = 'to be thrown down').
-- 172: note also that Krecher does not interpret u₃-mu-un as "lord", but instead - on the basis of the later sources that write u₃-mun instead of U = umun - as a shulu-demon. The evidence for this seems weak, however.
 
44: še-eb saŋ zi-bi ama ir₂-ra-<ke₄> / ir₂-re eŋ₃-ŋa₂-tuš 
  Its brickwork raised high now lies in mourning like a lament woman.
  cf. Loehnert: "Its towering brickwork is now crouching like a mother in mourning".

Commentary SKL 172f.:
-- 173: notes that ama ir₂-ra "mourning woman" also occurs in Gud. Statue B v 4. See also the discussion of this term and its Akkadian equivalent ama'erru in Shehata 2009.  The literal translation of ama with ummu = 'mother' in the later source is almost certainly a misinterpretation.

45: gi-guruš₃(URUxGU)-bi mu-lu ša₃ gig-ga-ke₄ / šu al-gur-gur-re
  Its reed matting? is wrenched over like one with a sick stomach.
  Loehnert: Its reed mats are convulsing like a person in colic.

Commentary SKL 173f.:
-- 173: gi-gur₅-uš translated with Akk. hurdu = "a door mat". cf. also Gudea Cyl. A col. xxii l.2: e₂-gi-guruš₃ = "reed mat house".
-- 173: šu--gur-gur is the equivalent of garaaru = to curl up.

46: gi-sal-la-bi <siki>-<e> <ze₂>-a-gin₇ ki am₃? / [. . .] <x> <an>-<us₂>?
  Its door posts, like one tearing out the hair ...
  Loehnert: Its reed eaves lay on the ground like torn out hair.

Commentary SKL 174f.:
-- gi-sal-la = akk. gisallu = "reed roof fences"
-- 175: ki--us₂ translated  with ittalu (for utulu) in later source.

47: bur₂-ra-ah-bi su-din dal-la-gin₇ <du₆>-<la> / al-<gir₅>-<gir₅>-re
  Its ... like flying bats ...
  Loehnert: Its door wings disappear like bats flying into the ruin mound. 

Commentary SKL 175f.:
--176: gir₅ = halaapu = to sink into, to disappear. Occurs often in context of water disappearing down into a crack (in the earth).
-- Note that in PSD B no progress is made with bur₂-ra-ah which is translated "(an architectural term)" along with a couple other parallels.
-- cf. also commentary in Loehnert 2009: 284 where it is assumed that bur₂-ra-ah is a writing of ŋiš-bur₂, a term that occurs in LSUr in connection with a temple and may mean something like "door ornament".

48: za₃-du₈-bi mu-lu u₃-mu-un-e <tu₁₁>?-<ba>?-<gin₇> / šu-ur-a mi-ni-ib₂-<be₂>?
  Its door posts, like one struck by his master ...

Commentary SKL 176f.:
-- 176: parallel SBH 46: 26 has za₃-du₈-bi mu-lu a-tu₅-a-gin¬₇ šu-ur₃-ra ba-ni-ib-ri.
-- 176: za₃-du₈ translated with sippu = "threshhold". 
-- 177: if šu-ur is taken as a writing for šu-ur₃ then šu-ur₃-ra -- ri would mean literally "die darueberfahrende Hand darauf/daran legen" - an action that would make sense with a-tu₅ 'to wash', but Krecher doubts that this text corresponds directly to the later parallel. 
-- notes also that Loehnert 2009: 285 cites Karahashi with notes that the compound verb šu--ur₃ can mean "to level", a destructive action.

49: ŋišig SI <a₂>-bi bar ba?-ab-<du₁₁>? 
  Its door hinges ...

Commentary SKL 177f.:
-- 177: SBH 46: 27 has ŋišig A₂.SI-bi bar-bi AK-a-ab. As Krecher notes A₂.SI occurs several times in connection with doors and may mean something like "hinge" and sometimes has a determinative for a metal (urudu).
-- 178: notes that the verb bar--AK is otherwise unattested. Cf. Loehnert 2009: 286 who cites Attinger who notes the Akkadian translation of bar--du₁₁ as šagaašu, a destructive action meaning "to tear down" or the like.

50: e₂ zi-de₃ ŋiššu-di-eš-bi ŋišsaŋ-<kul>-bi / še am₃-ma-ni-[ib]-<ša₄>
  The true house, its locks and its bolts moan.
  Loehnert: "The rightful houses's bar and bolt are groaning".

Commentary SKL 178:
-- 178: discusses ŋiššu-di-eš and ŋišsaŋ-kul which often occur together and must mean something like "bar" and "bolt". 

51: e₂ zi a mu-bi ga-nam-me-a <lil₂>-la₂ [. . .] / ni-in-<ku₄> [. . .]
  True house, whose names is indeed woe, has become a phantom.
  Loehnert: The rightful house, whose name has become woe, is moaning.

Commentary SKL 178f.:
-- 179: note that VAT 1337+ has [. . .] mu-bi ga-la-me-a še am₃-ma-ni-ib-ša₄, repeating the verbal form of the previous line, but that all of the other identifiable parallels have lil₂-la₂ am₃-ma-ni-in-ku₄ which is rendered in Akkadian as ana zaqiiqi ittuur = "to turn to air/a ghost".
-- 179-180: lengthy discussion of lil₂-la -- ku₄ as "zu einem Schemen machen" is given, which remains far preferrable to Tinney's "to make haunted" (proposed in the Nippur Lament).
-- 180: defense of "ku₄" meaning "to turn into" seems unnecessary, since this meaning is now widely accepted, but it may not have been at the time.
-- 181 n.517 gives references to other occurrences of ga-nam-me-a, which probably means something like "truly" or "indeed".

52: ama₅ <e₂> <gal> mah-a lil₂-la₂ am₃-ma-ni-<in> [. . .]
  The cultic sleeping chamber, the Egalmah, has become? a phantom.

Commentary SKL 181:
-- parallel SBH 46: 33 repeats the same verb as in previous line.

53: <x> <x> <mušen>-e? gud₃(U₂.KI.SI₃.GA) [. . .]
  ... bird ... nest ...

Commentary SKL 182:
-- 182: considers the possibility that the broken bird name is darmušen = "francolin" = Akk. ittiduu  - a bird that makes a loud shriek.

54: traces of signs at beginning of line

Commentary SKL 183:
-- 183: parallels in VAT 1337+ and SBH 46: 37 are too broken to be of use here.

2: a-a {d}mu-ul-lil₂ saŋ ŋi₆-ga-na ba [. . .] / gu₂-nu <x>
  Father Enlil ... his black-headed people ...

Commentary SKL 183f.:
-- 183-84: notes parallels in VAT 1337+ and SBH 46: 42, 44:
  mu-lu ka-naŋ-da ba-an-da-gur-ra lil₂-la₂-da // saŋ-ŋi₆-ga-na ba-an-da-sal-la lil₂-la-da, which are translated: ša maati iskipu ana zaqiiqi (utirru) // ša ṣalmaat qaqqadu umas.ṣuu = "the one who flattened the land turned it into a phantom / the one who scattered the black-headed people (turned it into a phantom)".
-- 184: does not see a connection between later parallels and the verb gu₂-nu, however.

3: <kur>? <kur>? traces ba-da-dal-dal
  ... the hordes of locusts? fly about/away

Commentary SKL 184f.:
-- a 1st mill. parallel has buru₅mušen mu-da-an-dal-dal, which is why Krecher restores "a horde of locusts flies about/away" here.

4: one line broken or erased
  Krecher restores: [uru₂-ŋu₁₀ eŋ₃-gig-ga ba-ni-in-ku₂?]
  He causes something terrible to consume? my city.

Commentary SKL 185:
-- restored on basis of SBH 46: 46 and another 1st. mill. parallel.

5: <u₃>-<mu>-<un>-<e> unu₂(TE.UNUG) mah-ŋu₁₀ šu pe-el [. . .] / ba-ab-du₁₁
  The lord defiled my lofty sanctuary.
Commentary SKL 185:
-- notes that the lines corresponds to SBH 46: 47 and another 1st mill. parallel.

6: e₂-ŋu₁₀ im-ta-e₃ bar-ta mu-un-KU.KU
  (The inhabitants) left my house and are roaming around? outside it.

Commentary SKL 185f.:
-- 185: notes that parallel in SBH 46: 48 has -KU.KU-be₂ suggesting that the verb is to be read -dib-dib-be₂ here.

7: e₂-ŋu₁₀ e₂ zi-de₃ šu pe-el-la₂ ba-ab-du₁₁
  My house, the true house, has been defiled.

Commentary SKL 186 notes that this line is parallel to SBH 46: 49 and another 1st mill. source.

8: {d}mu-ul-lil₂-le uru₂-ŋu₁₀ uru₂ zi-da / a-še-ra ba-an-nu₂
  Enlil caused my house, the true house, to lay in mourning.

Commentary SKL 186 notes that this line is parallel to SBH 46: 50 and another 1st mill. source.

9: e₂ ša₃ <hul₂>-la ma-<du₃>-a-ŋu₁₀ a-še-er-re ma-tuš
  My house, which was built for me in joy (now) lays for me in mourning.

Commentary SKL 186 notes that this line is parallel to SBH 46: 51 and another 1st mill. source. Argues that the verbal forms should be corrected to ba- because the later parallels have ba- instead of ma-.

10: e₂ mu-tin ba-ra-ŋin/men₃-na-ŋu₁₀ a-še-er ba-da-<ti>
  From my house where wine once flowed comes mourning.

Commentary SKL 186f.:
-- 186-87: notes that SBH 46 rev. 1 has: mu-tinin im-ta-de₂-e a-še-er im-ta-an-de₂ = Akk. ša karaana imluu/innaquu taaniihu ittanqi, where both of the difficult verbs in the earlier version are replaced with de₂ = 'to pour out'.
-- 187: argues that DU = ŋen is to be read "men₃" in ES. Cites a possible parallel to this in CT 42, 7 iii 13f. where the verb is written syllabically as -me₂-na.
-- 187: interprets -ti as a syllabic writing of -de₂.

11: e₂ I.A.AN KAx[. . .]?-e ba-zi-ga-ŋu₁₀ ir₂-re / ba-zi-zi
  Krecher reads: e₂ imgaga! ku₂?-e at beginning of line
  My house which was raised up ... (now) rises up in lamenting.

Commentary SKL 187:
-- 187: parallel in SBH too broken to be useful. notes that imgaga = AŠ₂.A.AN = emmer wheat, but going from "TUR" to "AŠ₂" seems like a bit of a stretch. And then to move from this to a festival involving eating wheat is going even further.

12: <ma₂>-gur₈-re <ma₂> eŋ₃-da-<ba> <gur₃>-ŋu₁₀ / a-še-er ba-an-gur₃
  My barge which was one laden with meal offerings is now laden with mourning.

Commentary SKL 187f.:
-- translation based primarily on later parallel in SBH: makurru ša nindabuu izbil taaniih izzabil = "the barge which is carrying offerings is now carrying lamenting". reading eŋ₃-da-ba as a syllabic writing of nidba = nindaba.

13: <a>? <al>? <x> <NE> <ba>? <x> a-ŋu₁₀ / a traces

Commentary SKL 188: SBH 46 rev. 4 has i₇-de₃ a sikil-la tum₂-tum₂-mu a <hul> [. . .] de₂-e: "the river which once carried clean water is now carrying dirty water" - but it does not seem like the traces in the OB version support this restoration.

  ... lord? Enlil said it?

Commentary SKL 189: notes that it is unusual that the name of Enlil is written in the normal dialect when throughout the text it is written in Emesal. Also considers the possibility that lines 11 and 12 are completely identical and that the second is an accidental repetition that should be removed.

-- Notes that the first person plural forms in these lines may refer to a chorus of singers who are singing this part of the text. 
-- Notes also that ub-lil₂-la is the equivalent of ibratu = 'open-air shrine' and disagrees with Jacobsen's interpretation of this lexeme as 'cemetary'.

Commentary SKL 190:
-- notes that for lines 32-38 there is a parallel in VAT 605+ (VS 2, 8) col. iii 35f., but since only the ends of the lines (and the first sign in the line that corresponds to 34') are preserved, not much can be resconstructed on the basis of them.
-- considers the possibility that BU is to be read gid₂ and that it corresponds to the instrument gi-gid₂ or gi-di(d) = embuubu, maliilu, nišhu, or šulpu (according to MSL 7, 9). See Shehata 2009 for a more detailed commentary to this instrument.

Commentary SKL 190f.:
-- 190: notes that it would be possible to read A.KA as ugu₂ and A.IGI as ir₂, but since there are other instances in which igi--bar and ka--bar "to open the mouth" occur in apposition (he cites CT 15, 18: 36-37), this interpretation is probably preferable.
-- 191: interprets ša-ra-ge as a form of the verb ša-ra(g) = ubbulu = "to dry", which is translated this way in the first mill. bilingual SBH 41: 3f. in a very uncertain context. Also, since this translation doesn't really make sense here Krecher considers the possibility that it is a writing of šilig = 'to stop' and also 'to destroy', noting however that the shift from /l/ to /r/ in intervocalic position is difficult to explain. 
-- 192: going with the interpretation of ša-ra-ge as a reading of šilig, Krecher proposes to translate the expression in these two lines: "den Tag beschliessen", but this after all of the assumptions this would require, this seems to really be stretching it.

Commentary SKL 192f.:
--192: this line seems to be attested as either a single line in the middle or the end of a text in other sources as well. Krecher cites BE 30, 1 iii 4; VS 10, 102 ii 31; CT 42, 26 rev. 9; SBH 3 rev. 6; and SBH 17: rev. 3-4, which offers the Akkadian translation [. . .] kiima ša uumu matiima ajjiš allak. Note also that the variants ma/ŋa₂-a-a-bi/ba are attested for me-na-gin₇ at the beginning of this line in these parallels.
--192: notes that ma-a-a, sometimes contracted as ma-a and ma-e, corresponds to Akk. eekaa = "where?", corresponding to ajjiš "where to?" in this line.
--193: the translation of the line remains difficult with Krecher proposing: "Wann haette ich so umhergehen muessen und wohin gehe ich (nun)?"

Commentary SKL 193f.:
-- 193: Notes that these lines appear to be related to 4 R 24, 2: 3f., which serve as the basis for the restorations.
-- 194: notes that saŋ--ze₂-eŋ₃ corresponds to saŋ--šum₂ translated as haašu 'to hurry' in the 1st millennium parallel source and in lexical lists.
-- 194: the -men₃ in 35' and 36' is interpreted as a form of -ŋu₁₀ in pronominal conjugations, understood in the sense of "von mir gilt", which seems like a bit of stretch, and leaves too much unexplained. Note also that the first person referent is not in the 1st mill. parallel source, if this source is indeed a proper parallel. Note, for example, that the line about arali (4 R 24, 2: 5) is not present in this composition.
-- 194: commentary to gi-gun₄-na "high tower", which Krecher interprets as a high terrace on a ziggurat.
-- 194-95: the phrase mu-lu kuše-sir₂ ma-al-la is translated with lu''uu = unclean, soiled in the first millennium parallel source suggesting that the act of wearing sandals in the temple was considered to be a violation of cultic norms.

Commentary SKL 196f.:
--196-97: argues that the same three lines occur in AO 6905a (TCL 16, 68) and the syllabic parallel PRAK C 121 col. iv l.5-7.
-- 197: parallel expression i-bi₂ u₄-da-ke₄ with ša₃ u₄-da-ke₄ also occurs in CT 44, 14: 21f.

Commentary SKL 198:
-- line can be partially restored on the basis of W 16743cg, which also contains the verbal form [. . .] kuš₂-u₃-nam followed by ir₂-re. Note that even there, however, the occurrence of the expression u₄ te ba-zal is uncertain.

Commentary SKL 198f.:
-- 198: Krecher assumes that all of these lines were followed by the content of l.31'.
-- 199: notes that the temples and goddesses in these lines also occur further down in W 16743cg and in SBH 5 rev. 4-7 and 12-14.
-- 199-200: Dingirmah in l.34' is one of the names for the "mother goddess". See also RA 17: 50, a balag to Dingirmah. Commentary to this goddess with additional references is provided here.
-- 200: more commentary to Ninnibru.
-- 200: Commentary to Nin-gagia. For commentary to ŋa₂-gi₄-a = "closter" see also commentary to col. ii l.50
-- 201: restores l.39' this way because the same line occurs at the end of the parallel lists of goddesses and temples in SBH 5 and W 16743cg.

Commentary SKL 201: makes a very tentative attempt to suggest a restoration of these two lines on the basis of SBH 33 rev. and 4 R 11 rev. which contain a litany that is similar to the litany that follows these two lines, but seems unconvinced by this ("Doch ist dies nur eine unsichere Vermutung").

49': [. . .] 
Krecher restores: [e-lum-e u₃-mu-un kur-kur-ra]
  Lofty one, lord of all the lands.
50': [. . .] zi <x> [. . .]
Krecher restores: [ša₃ su₃-da-ke₄ e-ne-eŋ₃] zi-da [. . .] 
  One whose mind is unfathomable, at the true word ...
51': [. . .] gi₄-gi₄ <x> 
Krecher restores: [eŋ₃-du₁₁-ga-na nu-<gi₄>-gi₄-<de₃> 
  One who when he speaks the word cannot be overturned.
52': [. . .] šu nu-bala-e-<de₃>?
Krecher restores: [{d}mu-ul-lil₂ du₁₁-du₁₁-na] šu nu-bala-e-<de₃>
  Enlil, the one who when he speaks it cannot be changed.

Commentary SKL 201f.:
-- 201-202: notes that these four epithets of Enlil occur in SBH 1 rev. 15-18; SBH 2 rev. 10-47; SBH 14: 13-17; SBH I: 4-11; and W 20030, 9: 52-55; and possibly also in SBH 33, which was tentatively proposed to contain the same litany that begins in lines 47'-48'. 
-- 202: commentary to e-lum as an epithet of Enlil given to col. iii l.55 (p.183 of SKL). Note Akkadian translation of this word in SBH 1 as kabtu.
-- 202: commentary to -d/r Auslaut with su₃ in the expression ša₃ su₃-d/ra(₂) as well as a discussion of what this expression means.
-- 202: argues that these lines (in the parallel sources) contain headless genitives.
-- 203: note translation of eŋ₃-du₁₁-ga-na in SBH 1 as ana qibiitišu.
-- 203: note the translation of du₁₁-du₁₁-na as ša ṣiit piišu in SBH 1. But note also that this source is from the late 1st millennium, and this form is not preserved in SK 25 and was probably written differently if it is in fact parallel to the same line in SBH 1.

end of column: appears to be a number written on the bottom edge of this column

col. viii
one or two lines broken, which are followed by a double dividing line on the tablet
1': mu-da-<ti>? [. . .]
2': <hul>?-a? mu-<da> [. . .]
3': sa₁₂-du an-na [. . .]
4': ama uru₂ saŋ-ŋa₂ [. . .]
5': <x> AB ir₂ <x> [. . .]
6': [. . .] <x> <IM>? [. . .]
NOTE: Krecher does not include these lines (1'-6') in his transliteration and seems to be assuming that they belong to a different part of the tablet, beginning his transliteration of the column with the following lines and assuming an 8-line break. See commentary SKL 203, where this piece, VAT 1396, is argued not to belong to this part of the text, which would leave a break of approximately eight lines.
Following Krecher's renumbering and restorations, the lines in this column are reconstructed:
1: [. . .] [hul-lu] <mu>-[un] [. . .]
  ... destroy ...
2: [. . .] <hul>-lu mu-<un> [. . .]
  ... destroy ...
3: [. . .] <a> [. . .] <hul>-lu mu-<un> [. . .]
  ... destroy ...
4: [. . .] <ra>? <an>? <hul>-lu mu-<un> [. . .]
  ... destroy ...

Commentary SKL 203: these lines possibly contain the same refrain that may begin the litany in col. vii l.47f. See commentary to these lines for this speculative assumption.

5: [u₃]-<mu>-un ša₃-ba-na ta-am₃ <ma>-[al-la-bi]
  Lord, what is it that is in his heart?
6: {d}mu-ul-lil₂-le UŠ.TUG2PI <ku₃>-ga-na / ta-<am₃> [(an-ga-mu-)ri-a-bi]
  Enlil, what is it that he is thinking in his pure mind?

Commentary SKL 203f.:
-- 203-204: Paralleled by 4 R 11 rev. 15-20 = SBH 33 rev. 17-23 = KAR 375 ii 3-8. Note in particular the translation of line 6 as ina uzniišu elleeti miina ihsusa(nni) where the verb the expression ŋeštug₂ -- ri is translated "thinking in his mind".
-- 204: the phrases ša₃-ba-na ta -- ŋar and ŋeštug₂ ku₃-ga-na ta -- ri also occur in apposition in a similar context in VAT 610 (VS 2, 64) col. i 7-8.
-- 204: argues that u₃-mu-un in l.5 is unmarked because it is a casus pendus to Mulil-e in the next line.
-- 204-205: "UŠ.TUG₂" the ES reading for ŋeštug₂ is written the same way in CT 42, 1, rev. l.35 = SBH I: 53 (but note the duplicate PRAK C 5 writes only PI), as well as in BE 30, 6 iv 8 (which has MU.UŠ.TUG₂), and BA 5, 660, 30f.
-- 205: interprets -ri as ramuu = "to lay", in the sense of "liegt im Sinn" ( = 'have in mind').

7: kur na-aŋ₂-gi₁₆-le-eŋ₃-<ŋa₂> [im-ma-ni-in-ma-al] 
  The land he has put in a state of destruction.
8: a na-aŋ₂-gi₁₆-le-eŋ₃-[ŋa₂ i₇-da i-ni-in]-<de₂>
  Into the river he has poured the water of destruction.

Commentary SKL 205f.:
-- these lines are parallel to 4 R 11 rev. 21f. = SBH 33 rev. 24f.
-- 205: notes that "-a" is locative in l.7 and genitive in l.8, as reflected also in the Akkadian translation ina maatu šahluqta ištakan // mee šahluqti naara uštaabil.

9: u₂ teš₂ nu-zu <edin>-[na bi₂-in]-<mu₂>?
  Plants not knowing germination? he caused to grow in the steppe.
10: saŋ ŋi₆ edin-na <numun>-[e-eš mi-ni-in-ma]-<al>
  The black-headed people he has scattered like seeds in the steppe.

Commentary SKL 206f.:
-- these lines are parallel to 4 R 11 rev. 25f. = SBH 33 rev. 28f.
-- 206: note the translation of teš₂ as buuštu/buultu = baaštu/baaltu: 'shame'. The entire line is translated: šamme laa buušti ina ṣeeri ušteeṣaa = "he caused plants without shame/fertility? to grow in the steppe". 
-- 206: note also the literal translation of numun-e-eš -- ma-al as ana zeeri izzaru = "me made (the black-headed ones) into seeds". But as noted by Krecher, since the steppe is not a place where plants grow the image is probably intended to invoke how the black-headed people are scattered.

11: dam-a-ni <šir₃> [mu-na-ra i-lu mu-na]-<ab>?-<be₂>?
  His wife screams out a lament for him, calls out a mournful prayer for him.
12: {d}mu-<ul>-[lil₂-la₂ dam-a-ni {d}]<nin>-<lil₂>-la₂
  Enlil's wife, Ninlil [calls out a mournful prayer for him].
13: egi₂ <nin₉>?-[gal-a-ni ga-ša-an-keš₃]<{ki}>-a-ke₄
  The princess, his oldest sister, Ninkesh [calls out a mournful prayer for him].
14: <gu₃>?-<de₂>?-<de₂>? [ga-ša-an-nibru{ki}-ke₄] <i>-lu mu-na-ab-be₂
  Gudede?, Ninnibru, calls out a mournful prayer for him.
15: [. . .] <i>-lu mu-na-ab-be₂
  ... calls out a mournful prayer for him.

Commentary SKL 207f.: 
-- reconstructed on the basis of 4 R 11 rev. 29f. and VAT 1564 (VS 2, 23) i, 1-4.
-- 207: Krecher argues that the only part of the refrain that is repeated in the following lines is i-lu mu-na-ab-be₂.
-- 207: -ra with šir₃ = "to call out" or "to scream". Note also the Akkadian translation is.ṣarrahšu from ṣaraahu = "to sing (a lamentation)" and the translation of ilu -- e with qubee iqabbiušu, verbs that connote speaking rather than singing.
-- 208: ga-ša-an-keš₃{ki} restored on the basis of VAT 1564 i 6.
-- 208 n.585: gives references to the epithet gu₃-de₂-de₂ occuring with Ninnibru.

16: [. . .] [na]-an-til-e AB/DUB?-za igi-bar NI
  ... do not put an end to, look at your tablet?
17: [. . .] <ka>-na-aŋ₂ na-an-til-e
  ... do not put an end to the land.
18: [. . .] <x> da <ka>-na-aŋ₂ na?-an?-til-e
  ... do not put an end to the land.

Commentary SKL 208f.:
-- 208-209: Similar lines seem to occur in 4 R 11 rev. 35f., but since the beginnings of these lines are also broken in the parallel text they cannot be reconstructed. Notes that SBH 14 rev. 19f. has parallels with lines 19-22 but from l.22 the differences between this source and SK 25 are too great for it be possible to use it as a parallel source for the following lines. Krecher also notes that lines 22f. probably contain the direct speech of the goddess(es) pleading to Enlil.

19: [eŋ₃ bi₂-du₁₁-ga]-<zu> ba-e-diri-diri
  The things that you said are surpassing.
20: [ki na]-<aŋ₂>-<ku₅>-[ra-zu] <ba>-<e>?-de₃?-<til>
  The place that you cursed is annihilated (at your word).

Commentary SKL 209:
-- Notes parallels in KAR 375 ii 25-28, 4 R 11 rev. 39-42, SBH 14 rev. 19f., and CT 42, 1: 34f.
-- 209: note the Akkadian translations of these lines: el ša taqbuu tuutatter // eema tatmuu tagdamar, confirming that the verbs are to be translated in the 2nd person.
-- 209: notes that na-aŋ₂-ku₅-ra is short for erim₂--ku₅ = 'to curse', but it is now well established that nam--ku₅ means 'to curse'.
-- 209: Krecher is unable to explain the -da- in the verbal form at the end of l.20, but suggests something like "damit" or "dadurch" as a translation. The verbal infix -e-ni- is also noted, but the occurrences he cites are all late and are probably not of much use in understanding this infix. 

21: [sipa nu]-<gurum>-e e-<ze₂> e-<ni>-DU
  The shepherd who does not bow you have made lead the sheep.
22: [su₈]-<ba> u₃ <nu>-ku en-<nu>-<uŋ₃>-ŋa₂ ba-tuš <x>
  The shepherd who does not sleep you have placed on guard.

Commentary SKL 210:
-- Notes parallels in KAR 375 ii 29-32, 4 R 11 rev. 43-46, SBH 14 rev. 21f., and CT 42, 1: 36f.
-- 210: notes that "sipa" and "su₈-ba" seem to be used here as synonymns, but again these lines are reconstructed on the basis of later sources and should probably be used with caution. It is however interesting that the use of the same word in ES and the normal dialect might indicate that the words were thought to have slightly different meanings depending on which dialect is used to render them.
-- 210: presents evidence for reading UN in en-nu-uŋ₃ as as uŋ₃, giving other examples in which the term is followed by -ŋa₂. Note, however, that KAR 375 ii 31 writes en-nu-un-na here.

23: [. . .] <x> <x> za e₃ NI traces / ba?-an? [. . .]
  ...

Commentary SKL 210f.:
-- The (possibly) parallel source 4 R 11 rev. 47f. has [. . .] x zu a e₃-NI dub sa₆-ga-na ba-an-DU, which is translated [. . .] ... ṭuppi damiqtišu šutur = "he writes it on his good tablet" (sum.) / "write it on his good tablet" (akkadian).
-- 211: Krecher interprets dub sa₆-ga in the sense of "tablet of well-being". Note also that the Akkadian translation of the first verbal form in this line seems to be from hiaṭu = "to inquire, investigate".

24: traces <e₃>? am₃ <x> [. . .] <x>

  The word of An ...
30: u₄-<de₃> <ša₃> <eb₂>-[ba] <an>? <gu>?-[la]-<a>?-ri 
  That storm, the angry heart of the great An.
31: ša₃-ab-<hul>-ma-al-la {d}[mu-ul-lil₂-la₂]-ri?
  The one that is the wicked heart of Enlil.

Commentary SKL 211:
-- 211: Krecher cites some texts that may have parallel lines, but since all of these texts have different lines in the lines preceding these the parallels can only be used with caution. The sense of these lines in the Akkadian translations in the parallel sources is: "the word of An and the word of Enlil is a storm - the raging heart of the great AN, the wicked heart of Enlil".

32: <eŋ₃>? <e₂>! <zi>-<ŋu₁₀> <mu>? [. . .] <ba>?-ab-<gu>? <x> <x> <a>? 
  Possible parallels have: eŋ₃ e₂-zi-ŋu₁₀ ma-ab-gu-la-a-ri
  That which made my true house great (?)
33: [. . .] <uru₂>? zi-ŋu¬¬₁₀ <ba>?-ab-gu?-la?-a? [. . .]
  Possible parallels have: eŋ₃ uru₂ zi-ŋu₁₀ ma-ab-hul-a-ri
  (Is) that which destroyed my true city (?)
34: na-aŋ₂-tar eŋ₃ <e₂>-ŋu¬₁₀ <sag₂> [in-du₁₁-ga]?
  Possible parallels have: na-aŋ₂-tar eŋ₃ e₂-ŋu₁₀ sag₂ in-du₁₁-ga-ri
  (Is) the fate which scattered my house and possessions.

Commentary SKL 212:
-- The sources CT 15, 7: 10-12; PRAK C 97: 6-8; VAT 1544 (VS 2, 61): 4-6; and BL tf. LXX rev. 19-21, which are also cited as parallels for the preceding three lines are also cited as parallels to these lines. If these lines are in fact parallel, their meaning is relatively clear.

35: <an>?-še₃!(BA) i₃-zi nu-mu-[da-ma-ma]
  That which is raised up toward heaven he will not be able to be put down.
36: ki-še₃!(BA) i₃-ŋar nu-<mu>-[da-zi-zi]
  That which is put on the ground he will not be able to lift up.

Commentary SKL 212f.:
-- The sources CT 15, 7: 13f.; PRAK C 39: 1f.; VAT 1544 (VS 2, 61): 7f.; and BL tf. LXX rev. 22f., which, with the exception of PRAK C 39, are the same sources that are cited as parallels to the preceding lines are cited as parallels to these lines. It is from these sources that readings an-še₃ and ki-še₃ are drawn, but the writing of "ba" for "še₃" in an otherwise well written source seems to cast doubt on whether these sources are truly parallel.
-- 212-213: Of interest is the proverb SP 1.195, which is entirely identical to these two lines (with the exception that ŋar is written in the ES form ma-al), which is interpreted in the sense of "he who rises up will not be able to sit down, and he who sits down will not be able to rise up". 
-- 213: Krecher seems to have difficulties find a subject for the verbs in these lines, but if this really is a quotation from a proverb there shouldn't be any difficulties understanding the subject in the sense of the impersonal "he who" instead of requiring that the subject occur somewhere in the preceding lines.

Commentary SKL 213f.: 
-- The sources CT 15, 7: 15f.; PRAK C 39: 3f.; and BL tf. LXX rev. 24f., which are the same sources that are cited as parallels to the preceding lines are cited as parallels to these lines, but note that all of these sources appear to be too broken in these lines to be of much use here.
-- 214: discusses the reading hešx for LU₂ganatenu on the basis of the possible syllabic writing of this word as he₂-ša₃ in PRAK C 39:4 and PRAK C 97: 12. But he also notes that these two lines as they are preserved cannot be understood.

39: [. . .] <eŋ₃>-da-ab?-<il₂>-<en> me-ri eŋ₃?-da-ab?-il₂-en
  I lift ... I lift the feet ...
40: [. . .] <eŋ₃> da edin-<na> <x> <saŋ>? an-da?-sig₃-ge
  ... in the steppe ... I smite (or: lower the head).

Commentary SKL 214: 
-- Again the parallel sources CT 15, 7: 17f.; PRAK C 39: 5f.; and BL tf. LXX rev. 26, are cited as parallels, but again they are all too broken to be of much use here. 
-- 214: Krecher notes that the occurrence of the pronominal suffix -en in these lines is probably to be interpreted as the goddess speaking in the 1st person.
-- 214: Krecher interprets saŋ--sig₃ as "to sink the head", but has difficulties explaining mi-re--il₂ "to walk with lofty feet", since this expressions seems to refer to walking about proudly, which would not fit the context here. 

41: [me-e] <gig>-ga-<bi>-<še₃> am₃-ši-til₃-le-en
  I, indeed, am living in sickeness.

Commentary SKL 214:
-- restored on the basis of CT 15, 7: 19 and W 20030, 9: 48, which read: [me]-e gig-ga-be₂-eš eŋ₃-ši-ti-le. However, no true attempt is made to interpret what this line actually means other than to note that the expression "gig-ga-bi-še₃" may be a type of adverbial superlative.

42: <e₂>?-a nu-<mu>-[un?]-<til₃>?-en ŋa₂-la nu-mu-un-til₃-le-en
  I do not live in a house, I do not live apart from it.
43: dam-ŋu₁₀ nu-mu-[un-til₃-en dumu] <nu>-mu-un-til₃-le-en
  I do not live with a wife, I do not live with a son.

Commentary SKL 214f.:
-- cites CT 15, 7: 20f. as a parallel source for these lines. Notes also that this line is also partially preserved in W 20030, 9: 49.
-- 215: the writing ŋa₂-la is argued to correspond to W 20030, 9: 49 which has eŋ₃-ma-al where CT 15: 7, 20 has ma-al-la, and might mean something like "Besitz" ( = property/possessions), but the absence of "eŋ₃" and the writing ŋa₂-la in place of ma-al seems to be really stretching the parallel. Krecher also notes the possible connection with ma-la(g) = "girlfriend", which also seems unlikely here, especially since none of the writings for ma-la(g) in the parallel sources seem to be attested anywhere else.

44: i₃-niŋin-<de₃>-[en i₃-šu₂-šu₂]-<de₃>-en
  I roam about, I sink down (?).

Commentary SKL 215f.:
-- restored on the basis of CT 15, 7: 22 = BL tf. LXX rev. 31 = BE 13701: 6. Note here the addition of the unpublished source BE 13701, which apparently has parallel lines from here to l.49.
-- 216: notes that since "šu₂" doesn't have a "d-Auslaut" the writing of -de₃ is difficult to explain.
-- 216: šu₂ is understood in the sense of ereepu, rabuu, and kataamu as "to sink down, lower oneself".

45: gud₃(U₂.KI.SI₃.GA) [gig-ga-bi u₄-šu₂-a me-en]
  I am, ... a nest ...
46: šilam amar-bi [niŋin-na-ŋu₁₀ me-en]
  I am a wild cow who roams around with its calf.
Commentary SKL 216:
-- restored on the basis of CT 15, 24: 4f. = BL tf. LXX rev. 32f. = BE 13701: 7f. Note that CT 15, 7, used to restored the preceding lines, is no longer used here.
-- 216: Krecher is unable to translate u₄ šu₂-a men₃ in l.45, but notes that CT 15, 7, 23-24 has the verb u₂ ku₂ me-en for u₄ šu₂-a and the verb a naŋ-an me-en for niŋin-na-ŋu₁₀, which are easier to translate, and that the choice of these phrases may have been conditioned by them sounding similar to the verbs in the other sources. Notes also that u₄-šu₂ typically refers to the setting of the sun. 

47: ga-ša-an me-en <mu>-[lu im₂-ma uru₂-a ku₄-ra me-en]
  I, the lady, am one who is a (foreign) messenger who goes into the city.

Commentary SKL 217:
-- restored on the basis of CT 15, 7: 25; CT 15, 24: 6 = BL tf. LXX rev. 34 = BE 13701: 9.
-- 217:  notes that lu₂ im₂-ma is translated both šaanuu and laasimu = 'runner'. Note also the phonetic writing of ku₄(-ra) as kur₂ in CT 15, 7.

48: dilmun{ki} <sug>-[ga ma₂ su-a me-en] 
  I am a ship who sinks in the swamps of Dilmun.
49: šu-ku₆ ambar-<ra> [ma₂ niŋin-na me-en]
  I am a fisherman who steers a boat around the marsh.

Commentary SKL 217f.:
-- restored on the basis of CT 15, 7: 26-27; CT 15, 24: 7f. = BL tf. LXX rev. 35f. = BE 13701: 10f.; and VAT 1423 (VS 2, 19): 3f.
-- 217: discusses possible readings of ŠU.HA inconclusively. The lexical equivalent šu-HA.UD.DA = šukudakku is attested, as is the phonetic writing šu-kam-ma (in a text from Ugarit), both of which suggest a reading šu-ku₆ for the term.
-- 218: notes the two occurrences of LAGABxA with its readings sug and ambar confirmed by the Auslauts in these two lines. Notes also that both words are synonyms for marshes or swamps.
-- 218: notes that su is the older writing of su₃ in its meaning "to sink".
-- 218: niŋin is probably to be understood in the sense of its Akkadian translation "sahaaru" 'to go around (in circles)' here.
-- 218: notes also the very literal translation of this line in BRM 4, 6: 10.

50: uru₂-ŋa₂ ur-re men₃ [sila-ŋa₂ KAS₄ me-en] 
  In my city I am an enemy, on my street I am a foreigner.
51: ki ulutim₂(SIG₇!.ALAM) ama <ugu>-[ŋa₂-ka e¬₂ ur₅-ra-bi me-en]
  On the face? of the mother who bore me, I am ...

Commentary SKL 218f.:
-- restored on the basis of CT 15, 8: 28f.; CT 15, 24: 9f.; BL tf. LXX rev. 37f.; and VAT 1423 (VS 2, 19): 5f.
-- 218: ur-re = "enemy"; cf. the syllabic writing "uri" in CT 15, 24. 
-- 218-219: KAS₄ is in apposition to ur-re and probably corresponds to ubaaru, which means "foreigner" (cf. Lambert in BWL 259). Note that the term also occurs in Gilg. Tablet XII l.15 describing Enkidu in the netherworld as kiima ubaaraaataama. Also cites other instances in which KAS₄ seems to have this meaning and/or occurs in apposition to ur-re, including the bilingual reference SBH 25: 32f. where ur-re men₃ is translated nakraaku and KAS₄ men₃ is translated ubaaraaku.
-- 219: for his idiosyncratic translation of l.51, Krecher cites Landsberger's discussion of this line in WO 3, 77. In this interpretation SIG₇.ALAN is read uktin, understood to mean "hervorstechend", is argued to be related to ulutin (KI.KAL), but Krecher notes that it typically means "birth" or "birthplace", a meaning that doesn't really fit the context here.
-- 219: similarly, the translation of e₂-ur₅-ra as "debt slave", which is also discussed by Landsberger in WO 3, is based on the Akkadian equivalences biit hubullu and biit aššaabu, which are nonetheless only attested in later texts and are thus somewhat suspect. Given all the uncertainties here, it is probably best to leave this line untranslated.

52: <lipiš> <i₃>-ŋal₂ <a₂> [nu-ŋal₂ me-en]
  I am one who has courage, but does not have strength.
53: [egi₂ men₃] <ama₅>-<ŋa₂> [lipiš nu-ŋal₂ me-en]
  I, the princess, am one who does not have courage in my cultic (sleeping) chamber.
rest of column broken

Commentary SKL 220f.:
-- restored on the basis of CT 15, 8: 30f.; CT 15, 24: 11f.; CT 42, 8: 30f.; BL tf. LXX rev. 39f.; and VAT 1423 (VS 2, 19): 7f. cf. also the Akkadian translation of l.52 in BRM 4, 6: 11a = ša libbi iišuu u emuuqu laa iišuu anaaku.
-- 220: cites instances in which lipiš occurs in apposition to a₂ = "strength" and corresponds to libbu and ṣurru = "heart" or "courage".
-- 221: notes that there are approximately 12 lines that are borken after this line, but that since the parallel sources all have differing lines from this point on none of them can be used to reconstruct the broken lines in this composition with certainty.

col. ix
<appears to be a number written on the top edge of the tablet>
NOTE: Krecher assumes that 15 lines are broken at the beginning of the column
1': [. . .] šu
2': [. . .] UD? ni [. . .]
3': [. . .] <x> <x> [. . .]
4': [. . .] ki
5': [. . .] a
6': [. . .] <x>
at least seven or eight lines completely broken
Krecher seems to start the numbering of the lines in this column with the following lines, assuming that the fragment VAT 1396 does not belong here on the tablet (see commentary p.221):
1: [. . .] <x>
----- double dividing line on tablet ------ (but note that this dividing line is not included in Krecher's edition).
2: [. . .] <x> <x> <am₃>?
3: [. . .] <igi>? <x> <x>
4: KU-a-ni [. . .] x x x 
5: [. . .] <IM>? [. . .] gi <x> ŠI A am₃-SAR? <x> <x> / [. . .] <na> nu-ta im-me
  Note that Krecher is much more cautious about restoring the signs in this and the preceding lines.
6: [sa₁₂-du-an]-<na> ga-ša-an-i₃-si-in-na
  The bookkeeper of An, Ninisina
7: <ama> <uru₂> saŋ-ŋa₂ ga-ša-an-tin-ug₅-ba
  The mother of the main city, Nintinuga.

Commentary SKL 221: notes that these two lines, as in ii 8-15 and ii 46-47, may be repeated as a refrain in the following lines.

8: <ša₃>! <e₂> zi-bi ba-an-gul-la-ŋu₁₀
  My heart, whose true house is destroyed. 
9: <ša₃>! <uru₂> zi-bi ba-an-hul-a-ŋu₁₀
  My heart, whose true city is ruined.
10: <balaŋ>-di ša₃-ab ulu₃-bi ba-<tu₁₁> [. . .]
  The lamenter: my heart whose people have been knocked down.

33: [. . .] <a>-ŋu₁₀
  ...

Commentary SKL 221: 
-- notes that these lines may have some parallels with CT 36, 43f. rev. col. i 8-11, but these parallels are very tenuous and do not help much in reconstructing the content of these lines.
-- 221: notes that gul and hul in lines 8-9 also occur in col. viii 32f.
-- 221: notes also the re-occurrence of balaŋ-di, which also occurs in iii 15. cf. CT 36, 43f. rev. i 10: balaŋ-di u₄ ša₃-ba nu-pad₃-de₃-da-a "Lament singer! the storm whose interior one cannot find".

34: <u₂> <im>!-<ma>-<zu>! [u₂ na]-<ma>-<ku₂>-e
  I know hunger, but I do not eat food.
35: <a> ba-ni-zu! a na-<ma>-<na₈>?-<na₈>?
  I know thirst, but I do not drink water.

Commentary SKL 221f.:
-- 221: reconstructed on the basis of CT 36, 43f. rev i l.13f., which has nearly identical lines.
-- 221-222: consider the possibility that -bi in the following lines refers to a group of people and that this group of people is the subject of the verbal forms in these lines, leading to the translation: the people who know how to give food do not give me food, etc. But this seems translation seems improbable for contextual, grammatical, semantic, and theological reasons, and is rendered even more uncertain by not knowing to who or what the -bi in the following lines actually refers. Note also that the -ma- in the verbal forms need not be the 1st singular dative infix, since -ma- could also be -mu- conditioned by vowel harmony with the "a" in the preceding prefix "na-".

36: i-bi₂-bi ir₂-ta na-ma?-<X>.DU (= e₃?)
  Their eyes ... from lamenting ...
37: <x> bi ki ma-<al>!-<e > na-ma-<kuš₂>?-<u₃>?
  ... do not stop? ...

Commentary SKL 222f.:
-- restored on the basis of the possible partial parallel with CT 36, 43f., rev. i l.15f. which has: i-bi₂-bi ir₂-ta ba-KU-ba-a-ta // gu₂-bi ki ma-al-e nu-kuš₂-u₃. cf. the translations in 222 n.639-640: "his eyes were seized by tears // his neck did not tire from looking at the ground.
-- 222: note again the interpretation of -bi as a collective plural.
-- 222 n.640 and 223: -- the very partial parallel to these lines in SBH 46: rev. 20f. is also cited, but there are too many differences between these lines and the lines in this line and the line in the other possible parallel source for them to be helpful.

38: [. . .] en₃-du-bi ba-gi₄!(AM)? ad-ša₄-bi ba-gi₄
  ... their songs cease, their singing ceases.

Commentary SKL 223:
-- 223: cites Hallo in JAOS 83, 174 for the read en₃-du for LI.DU = "song".
-- 223: cites the translation of ad-ša₄ as nasaasu, which he translates "to call with a trembling voice", noting the connection with nissatu = "lament". This phrase is discussed more extensively in Shehata 2009, who argues that it is a type of singing style or vocal manipulation.
-- 223: interprets -gi₄ in this line in the sense of "to change" or "to be altered".  

39: <uga>?(U₂.SI₃.GA)mušen nu-da-TE.BA.DA?
  ... the raven? ...
40: [. . .] <DU>? ab <x> ba-da

41: [. . .] traces
rest of column broken

col. x
entire column broken

Commentary SKL 223:
-- 223: notes that for the bird in l.39 to be read uga it would be necessary for the signs on the tablet to be U₂.NISABA(NAGA).GAmušen. He also cites a possible parallel with CT 15, 18: 39 where the raven occurs in a comparable context and is followed by lines that concern the playing of musical instruments by the wind.
-- 223: Krecher notes that col. x is exceptionally narrow and that it is probable that it was uninscribed.

&&VAT 1157 (VS 17, 48), flake from the surface of the middle of either the left edge of a tablet, or from the place on the tablet where a new column begins. The signs on the fragment are quite tiny, so the tablet to which the flake belonged must have been quite large, and was almost certainly not a single column tablet.

Source C₂ = VAT 1348 copied with VAT 1338 +: the middle flake from a tablet - does it belong to this source, though?. Note: it almost certainly does and it belongs near the beginning of col. iv of the reverse. Moreover, the piece contains some of the same lines as VAT 3702 (VS 10, 127), which also probably joins VAT 1348 and VAT 1338, source S7 in Loehnert's edition of Utugin. Note also that Loehnert assigns VAT 3702 to the same text (S15), but does not make the join.

  Note: the "mu" and the "ni" are very squeezed at the end of this line and the next. Note also that given the resemblance between the sign read as "e" here and the more or less clear "e" in l.12, it seems likely that this sign is "e" and not "zu". Note that a less likely, but none the less possible interpretation of this sign, in light of its partially similarity to "ku₃" in l.1 of the reverse, is "ku₃".

&&VAT 1351 (possibly columns ii and iii of the same tablet as VAT 1387 and? VAT 1385+1386). The tablet is very thin, with small careful writing that carries over on to the edge of the tablet. Note, however, most frequently this piece has been attributed to the same tablet as VAT 3416 (VS 10, 117).

2: *lu₂-*ŋu₁₀ *ba-*ra *ta-*aš-*NE.*RI *ga-*ša/ta *ba *mu-*da-*ŋal₂
  Note: the sign read as "ša" after "ga" in this line and the next is virtually indistiguishable from "ta" earlier in both lines and does not look like the very clear "ša" at the end of l.4 making it possible, if not likely, that the sign is "ta" instead of "ša".
3: <*a>? *ŋuruš(NIR) *šu-*ta *ta-*aš-*NE.*RI *ga-*ša/ta *ba *mu-*da-*ŋal₂

&&VAT 1387 (possibly col. i of same tablet at VAT 1385+1386): the left edge of a multi-column tablet with mostly single line in col. i of the obverse, but numerous double line in col. iv'' of the reverse. It seems a little odd that only the left edge from the middle of a tablet and the bottom edge of the same tablet survive, but it is nonetheless possible (though far from certain), that this piece belongs to the same tablet as VAT 1385 + 1386.

Note also that "ama" in this line and the next also seems to lack a top middle vertical, but since "da" in VAT 1385+1386 has two horizontal wedges inside the beginning of the sign, and there are other instances of abbreviated "ama" signs like this in this group of tablets, "ama" is nearly certain.

&&VAT 1462 (VS 2, 36), the top left edge, of what is probably a single column tablet. The reverse ends with a catch-line which corresponds to first line at the beginning of a new section of Tablet 19 of the first millennium version of UA. This section of UA also corresponds to the K.25 l.5f. of H 2 (containing the OB version of this section of the text): see Volk 1989: 30-32 for his transcription of this source and its parallels with H 2 and Tf. 19.

  NOTE: Volk reads the first two signs in this line "x x" and assigns this line to Tf. 19 30 = H2 K. 25 8, the latter of which begins with the signs "a ib₂-ba-ni" - the signs on the tablet are clearly "balaŋ di", however, ruling out Volk's attribution of this line to this part of the text.
5': <*na>-<*+aŋ₂>-<*erim₃>?-<ma>?-[ni-še₃ al-kuš₂-u₃-ni]
  NOTE: Tf 19 34-37 has four lines that begin with na-aŋ₂ in this section of the text, but H 2 10-21 appears to have 11-12 lines that begin with na-aŋ₂. This source appears to have fine lines that begin this way, but since in almost all instances the sign after "aŋ₂" is either completely or partially broken, it is very difficult to align these lines with the parallel lines in Tf. 19 and H 2, and the proposed reconstructions are largely guesses.

  Note: there is a possibility that the sign read as "ša" is "ta", since it is unclear whether there were wedges at the beginning of the sign like "ša" in the previous line, but when the sign is compared with "ta" in l.8', it looks much more like the "ša" in the previous line than like "ta" in l.8'.
7': *u₃-*KU *ri *dumu-*ni *i-*bi₂ *TE.*TE [. . .]

  Note: the sign at the end of this line is almost certainly the same sign as the sign at the end of the next line, which is directly beneath it on the tablet, and while "ul" is possible, the presence of clear "ki" signs in the same position in lines 5' and 6' (and in the following line) make it more likely that this sign is also "ki".
10': *šul-*gi *ki *še-*ša-*ša <*KI> [. . .]
  Note: the first sign read as "ša" is nearly identical to the second "ša" and the other "ša" signs on this tablet, and very little like "ta" in l.8' (and at the end of the next line) which has two small vertical wedges and no dividing vertical near the end of the sign like these two signs do.

  Note: the traces of the last preserved sign(s) in the line may belong to two box-like signs like "KU". 
3': [. . .] <x> <*ga>-<*ša>-*an *ki-<*bi>? *ba-<*la> [. . .]
4': [. . .] <*ur>-*ša *ba-<*hul>-<*lu> [. . .]
  Note: the sign read as "u₃" is almost certainly not "hul".
----*note it is possible that there is a single or double dividing line followed by blank space on the tablet here -------- (Cohen 1988: p.623 assumes a dividing line, but he places it after the next line) 
5': [. . .] <*gig>?(OR: <x> <ša>?) '' [. . .]
  Note: the traces of the one or two signs in this line suggest that the sign was very small and since the end of the second(?) sign is cut through by the top wedge of "ir" in the sign below and the sign is followed by blanks space, it is possible that this is a gloss or an erased sign and that there was not line here.
6': [. . .] <me>-*er-*si *ba-*hul-*lu-*a-<*ra> [. . .]
7': [. . .] <*ku₃> *ba-<*hul>-*lu-*a-*ra [. . .]
  Note: it is possible that the last preserved sign in the line is "bara₂" but the trace of a horizontal wedge on the inside of the second part of the sign is faint and "ra" seems more likely.
8': [. . .] <x> <x> <x> *ba-*ga-*ra-<*mu> [. . .]
  Note: the traces of the last preserved sign look more like "bi" than "mu", but there does seem to be a slight slanted wedge coming out of the beginning of the bottom of the sign which may indicate that the scribe may have started to write "mu" before continuing with "bi", meaning that the sign should be read "bi!" instead.

&&VAT 8201 (Cohen Parallel Source RR)
Note: this tablet, which is the top edge of a single column tablet is in the same box as another tablet with the same number, which is the bottom half of a single column tablet, which is badly defaced on the obverse, containing a composition written with larger signs and a different ductus which cannot belong to the same tablet (note for example that most of the reverse of the second VAT 8201 is uninscribed whereas the last fews lines of the reverse of the other piece continue until the end of the reverse). In the transliteration below this piece will be given the number "8201a".

NOTE: these two lines look like they have been inserted to be included in the main body of the text at the point where the single dividing line that forms the left edge of the lines is drawn.

3: ki-ru-gu₂ *2-kam-ma //
4: ŋuruš edin-e AB-e
NOTE: these two lines have a double dividing line that forms the left edge of the lines (unlike the other two lines on the left edge of the tablet which have only a single line for their left edge) making it likely that they mark the place on the obverse where the second kirugu ends.

&&AO 6905b (TCL 16, 68; pl. 131-32) = Cohen Source A - Note that MIN appears to be used in this source to indicate line divisions when two lines are written in the space of a single line on the tablet. Some of the lines in this source overlap with lines in Source C (added here for comparison), a source which is identified in its incipit as Uru Amirabi. There is also an OB parallel source (VAT 8201 = Cohen Source RR) which has overlapping lines, which are also included in the transliteration of this source.
Note 6905b is the bottom of a single column tablet, 5.4+cm in height  and 5.3cm in width written with a tiny microscript.

  Note: if the sign after "e₂" is "guru₅" it would have to be a long and poorly written sign, which is why it seems more likely that there are at least two different signs here. Note: it is also possible that the signs read as "si si/ke₄" are one sign, to be read "u¬₅".

  Note: the sign read as "ma" at the end of the line, which is written on the reverse of the tablet, is nearly certain since there does not seem to be a bottom part to the sign, and there is a dividing line (from the reverse) directly beneath it.
  C (40): šir₃ saŋ-e a-gin₇ ma-al-ma-al-e mu-gig an-na men₃ ni₂ me-lam₂-me-bi
16': [x x x] *na *ba-*ra-*gi₄-*a ga-ša-an e₂ an-na-ke₄ *ir₂-*še₃ i₃-*ŠIMIN-*ŠIMIN 
  Note: the traces of "MIN" with each of the "ŠI" signs at the end of the line are faint and possibly not present, but since they are definitely present with the two "ŠI" signs in l.18' it seems likely that they are also written here to distinguish this "ši", which is to be read "še₈" from the normal read of "ši" - in support of this note that the "ŠI" in this line written with "A" for "ir₂" definitely does not have "MIN" written with it. Note also that through the tablet "A" and "MIN" are generally indistinguishable making it likely that the sign after "gi₄" is to be read "a" and not "MIN".

  Note: there is definitely a "la" sign after "me-lam₂". Note also that it is tempting to read the signs after "MIN" as "he-pi" with a stray vertical wedge at the end of "HE", especially since "PI" is definite and the sign read as "te/ta" seems to have two Winkelhaken at the beginning of the sign instead of two horizontal wedges, like "ta" in l.14'. But this nonetheless makes the presence of a stray vertical difficult to explain and "te" may thus be more likely. In any case, however, the first part of the sign is consistent with "HE".

  C: from this point on source C seems to diverge from this source
21': [(x)] <*x> *a *me-*li-*a-*ta *A/MIN *šu *ba-*ši-*ti!
  Note: it is possible that there is only one sign at the beginning of this line before "a" and that this sign is "e₂". Note also that it is possible that the sign after "ta" in this line in the next is to be read "a" and not "MIN". Note also that the sign read as "ti" in this line and the next looks a little like "NUMUN" and is written like a "BAD" sign with a single diagonal wedge going through the top of the beginning of the sign. Note finally that signs from the end of a line on the reverse continue all the way up to "ti" which may indicate that the line was orginally longer and that the scribe did not have enough space to finish the line (or simply wrote the next part of the line in the next line - which might account for why there is blank space on the tablet after "ti!" in the next line).
22': <*x> <*ŋa₂>?-*ŋa₂-*a(-)*ta *A/MIN *šu *ba-*ši-*ti! <<blank space>>
  Note: there is a large blank space on the tablet between "a" and "ta", which may indicate that "ta" is not attached to the verbal from, but is instead the interrogative pronoun "ta", which is possibly followed by "A".
23': <*x> *ba-*ra-*ab-*e₃ *ta *mu  <<blank space>>
Bottom edge of the tablet:
24': [(x)] <*ta> *mu *he₂!-*em-*ma-*ab-*du₃ <<blank space>>
  Note: it is possible that the sign read as "he₂" in this line and the next is a sign like "tab", "pa" or "u₂" followed by either "he₂" or "ib₂", but it seems more likely that this is one sign to be read "he₂".  
25': [i]-*bi-*ŋu₁₀ *he₂!-*em-*ma-*ab-*du₃ <<blank space>>
  Note: the first sign in this line and the next two lines are no longer preserved on the tablet.
26': [ma]-<*al>-*la-*gin₇ <*ši>?-<*im>?-*e? *ma/ba-*ma/ba-*e/ra <<blank space>>
  Note: an alternative rendering of the second part of the line which is epigraphically ambiguous in all of the key places could be: <ŠI/KI> <im>-ma-ma-ma-ra - particularly difficult are the first sign read as "ma" which does not really look like the other "e" signs on the tablet (cf. for example "e" in the next line), the next two signs read as "ma", which could also be "ba", and the last sign in the line, which really does look like "e" in the next line, but could be a squeezed "ra" (which seems less likely).
27': [a]-<*še>-*gin₇ *ku₄-*ku₄-*a-*ŋu₁₀-*ne *lu₂-*lul *ga-*ba-*an-*ul₄-*e-<*en>
  Note: it is possible that the sign read as "gin₇" is "NE", but "gin₇" seems more likely.

This tablet, which is written in a microscript and is very similar in format to AO 6905b, is the top half of a small single column tablet which is 5.6+cm in height and 6.2cm in width, as well as 2.2cm in thickness at the thickest point in the middle of the tablet (compare to AO 6905b, which is 2.1cm in thickness at the thickest point of the tablet).

3: *ša3 *i-*na <*uru₂/e₂> *a-*ma <AK>? <a> <x> <x> <x> *si-*sa₂ nu-um-maša3-alAK
  Note: the gloss at the beginning of this line and all of the other lines on the obverse that have glosses at the beginning of the line are written on the left edge of the tablet before the beginning of the line. Note also that the glosses with "ma" (which really looks more like "DU" on tablet) and "al" are written to the bottom right of each of these signs. Note also that the copy (and Cohen) have "i-šar" before "si-sa₂", which would be an appropriate translation of "si-sa₂" and corresponds to the placement of "la ša₃" in the following line as a translation of the nu-um-ma-al in the following line, but these signs are no longer unambiguously legible on the tablet.
4: i-na <*am>*ama *KA *inim *gi-*na *i-*ša3-*ra-*tum '' *la *ša3nu-um-ma-al*AK
  Note: "gi-na" is written with signs that are the same size as the gloss "i-ša₃-ra-tum", which begins with "i-ša₃" below "inim" and continues with "ra-tum" after "gi-na". Note also that "la ša₃" are written directly before "nu-um" and are the same size as these signs, and "AK" is written to the top right of "al".

  Note: the gloss on the tablet edge is written between lines 5-6 and the gloss at the beginning of the next line is written between lines 6-7. Note also that "ki-ma" is written directly beneath "a-<x>" and the gloss "KA" (which is certain) is written to the bottom left of "KA".

&&AO 12999 (de Genouillac, FT II, pl.53)
Bottom right corner of what could have been either a multi-column or a single column tablet. Note, however, that the script is small, suggesting that the tablet had more than one column. Note that this source also doesn't seem to have any of the characteristic sign forms found in the older NFT tablets, and while it is possible that this is because the scribe used a cursive script because this was a multi-column tablet, it seems more likely that this tablet does not belong to the same group as the older tablets.

It is also possible that the sign after TE.A is "na", but there is a crack in the tablet that runs through the top half of the sign, which makes it difficult to determine what was in the space between the clear bottom horizontal wedge and the clear final vertical wedge. Perhaps the best possibility, though, is to read "e" here. Note that it is also possible that the sign read as "ma₂" is "RU" (compare "RU" = "šub" in l.4 of the reverse).

&&CBS 1689 + 4337 + 4358: left, middle fragment of a multi-column (probably 4-column) tablet containing the ends of lines from columns i and iv and complete lines from columns ii and iii. In spite of the claim that CBS 6897 joins the other pieces it is not physically attached to the other tablet and I could not find anything beyond a note in the drawer saying that it joins CBS 6891, so only 6891+ is collated below.

There has clearly been some confusion because 1689 looks just like 6891 when it is read backwards, making it very difficult to determine which piece is intended.  Here CBS 6891+ is transliterated in its entirety. Since the piece that is being transliterated as CBS 6891 does not line up at all with source C of "Dumuzi's Mother's Lament", the possibility should be considered that this tablet is actually CBS 1689 +. BUT note: this piece does definitely NOT join CBS 6897- so this is clearly from a different composition.

Note also: this piece is DEFINITELY CBS 1689+.

&&CBS 2218 + 2334 + N 3335 + 3365 (Loehnert 2009 pl.II - but note that only the reverse is copied and that the composition(s) on the obverse was/were assigned to an Ershemma published by Cohen (see entry above). Note also that col. iii? of the reverse seems to have been copied very poorly by Loehnert who doesn't seem to have understood the signs on it, so this column needs to be collated as well.

The source appears to be the left half of a multi-column tablet (probably containing 3 columns per side) containing relatively narrow columns with small script. The tablet is 5 1/2 inches in height and column i on the obverse is almost exactly 2 inches in width.

Looking at the tablet again, even if a dividing line is not visible, there does seem to be space between the end of this line and the following line, suggesting that there was a section divider here.

CBS 11396 (unpublished): obverse or reverse of a multi-column tablet with at least 4 (and probably 5) preserved columns (all of which are very short) from the middle of one side of the tablet and completely destroyed on the other. Following Cavigneaux, it will be assumed that this is the reverse of the tablet and the columns will be presented from right to left.

  NOTE: there is only enough space in the break after kur for one sign and the traces of the sign at the end of the break could either belong to bi₂ or sa₂.
  NCBT 688 54b: erim₃-ma-ŋu¬₁₀ kur₂-re sa₂ mi-ni-du₁₁ ŋa₂ mu-lu
  NOTE: AO 6905b has erim₃-ma-ŋu₁₀ kur-re sa₂ u₃-bi₂-du₁₁ ŋa₂-e mu-lu-bi / nu-me-en, which seems to be closer to this line.

11': <x>-<e>? <*mu> [. . .]
  Note: it is possible that the traces of the first two signs in the line belong to a single sign, or that the first sign is very small and the second sign is "lu". Either way, this source no longer seems to be parallel to NCBT 688 from this line on.

&&CBS 11932 (MBI 5) (CBS 11923 - number given incorrectly in MBI as 11932):
This is incorrect: the correct tablet number is in fact CBS 11932, and although columns i and ii on the obverse are almost entirely destroyed there are traces of signs from lines near the beginnings of both columns.

Obv. columns i and ii very poorly preserved, and most of the surface of the tablet is damaged, leaving only a few isolated signs in some of the lines in columns i and ii.

&&N 1373 + N 1386 + N 6329 + N 6809 + N 7910 (unpublished) -- numerous joins made by Peterson. Note: Jeremiah joins this tablet to (+) N 2372 + N 3101 + N 4572 + N 6471 + N 7401, but the size and shape of both of these halves of the tablet would seem to make it nearly impossible for them to belong to the same tablet, and both an inspections of the original tablets and a thorough examination of the photographs only seem to confirm how likely it is that these two pieces belong to separate sources. If they do belong to the same source then the obverse would have to have 50+ lines, which seems very unlikely for a single column tablet with the format the two tablets possess. Also, N 2372 + is ruled in every line and N 1373+ is not, which is another reason to dismiss the possibility that the two pieces belong together. For these reasons the tablets will be treated as separate sources. Note, however, it is quite possible, if not likely, that both sources were written by the same scribe and contain different extracts from the same lament.

&&N 3396 + N 7777 (unpublished), surface fragment from a composition with lines that closely parallel lines from Uruamairabi. I've noted that the tablet has a similar ductus to N 3342, and may even belong to the same tablet - if this is the case, then this source is probably also post-OB. Middle piece of a single(?)-column tablet, with no incipit, rubrics, or colophon preserved. See edition of UA for a more accurate transliteration of the obverse of this tablet.

Note this is a bilingual text with the Sumerian in the first column (on the left side of the tablet) and Akkadian directly adjacent to it in the second column (on the right sight of the tablet). The Akkadian is transliterated after the :: following the Sumerian line instead of transcribed separately.

** Ni 4357 (ISET I, p.146), a middle fragment from a multi?-column tablet (note that there are traces of signs before the break at the right edge of the obverse that Cohen attributes to the ends of the preserved lines on the tablet, but if the tablet is copied correctly these signs do not align with the signs that precede them and seem to be the first signs in the lines of a different column. However, the reverse, which is better preserved, does not have multiple columns, so it is possible that the obverse has been copied incorrectly, and the fragment will be transliterated as if the tablet only contains one column of text per side.

** Ash. 1930-230g (OECT 5, 45), possibly belongs to same tablet as OECT 5, 46, but it is unclear from Volk's description whether he assumed this to be the case. See also Civil in AuOr 1: 47 who considers the same possibility and suggests that the originals be checked.

NOTE: it is not clear from the copy, which labels the columns "I, II, and III", reading from left to right, whether the columns are copied in the sequence in which they appear on the tablet or whether they were rearranged to correspond to columns iv, v, and vi. So it is possible that col. "I", which is understood here to correspond to rev. col. iv is actually col. vi.

Uru Ašera

Beginning of col. i almost entirely broken, except for the last two or three lines, which are so eroded that only a few signs are visible on the copy. Col. ii is also almost entirely broken, except for the last one or two signs in lines 10'-13', making it very difficult to determine whether this tablet contained another composition for the beginning of this text.

** Edin 09.405-3 (BL 8ter)
  -- Collated from CDLI photo:
Square-shaped tablet, which looks a lot like a scribal exercise tablet. The doxology to Nisaba is not written on the bottom edge, but after a double dividing-line at the end of the reverse. Almost certainly not a lament.

** Repeated Passage: The first six lines of YBC 16392 are largely identical to lines that seem to begin a kirugu in the OB sources B = TCL 15, 8 and C= CT 42, 15, which nonetheless contain compositions that are different from the text on YBC 16392 and from each other. Note also that C contains lines from this section that are not in YBC 16392 or in source B, and continues with a few lines that partially overlap with the content of the 1st millennium (Seleucid) version of a text with the incipit e-ne-em-ma-ni i-lu i-lu. The main Seleucid source that has lines that "overlap" (very partially) with the OB parallel sources is VAT 555 (SBH 44), which at the beginning of the reverse has lines 11-38 of Cohen's edition, and which may begin at the place in the passage where the OB sources end.

*** There is another very partially repeating passage in col. v of BE 30/1, 8 which corresponds to some extent to a passage in col. iii of CT 42, 15, involving a command to the door-keeper to open up the door to the palace. A similar passage, again with fairly divergent content, occurs in the Seleucid source SBH 43, which Cohen includes as one of the main sources for this text.

** R.P. 2 - These lines, which occur at the beginning of Kirugu 4 in source C (the main source for the text) and in source J, which is also identified as a main source for this composition, also occur in source RR (VAT 8201), which appears to contain a different composition (but not that the signs on the reverse are difficult to read, making it difficult to determine whether they belong to this text or another composition).

** R.P. 3 - This passage -- which occurs in Source L (VAT 1339), which Cohen identifies as a main source for this text because it contains lines that occur in a kirugu of a 1st millennium source (Source W = K.3328) identified as uruamairabi, but not in any other OB sources for this composition -- is also attested in Dumuzi-Inana C, Dumuzi-Inana E1, and other texts which describe Inana bathing.


Following source L, this passage reads:
